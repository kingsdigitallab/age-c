The latter is a broader term covering mental disorders, psychosocial disabilities and (other) mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm” (WHO, 2022).</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;substance+abuse&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Substance Abuse<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films depicting ageing characters engaging in or affected by substance abuse. “As used in this discussion, substance abuse refers to excessive use of a drug in a way that is detrimental to self, society, or both.

Nevertheless, homosociality in this dataset may equally refer to films portraying same-sex friendship/bonding between females or males.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;elderhood&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Elderhood (friendship among elders)<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Following its dictionary definition, elderhood means the state, quality, or condition of being an elder. Expanding this definition, here, elderhood may be applied to films in which an elderly group forms a specific bond based on shared experiences related to ageing and/or cultural and collective memories.

In terms of representation and storytelling, this tag shall be applied to films portraying elderly characters accompanied by non-human figures (e.g. animals, plants, AIs, robots) with whom the elderly will form a special friendship.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;mentorship&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Mentorship<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: This tag may be applied to films in which a mentorship is formed between an elderly and a younger character, the elderly character generally representing the holder of wisdom and valuable life experiences that the younger character does not posses yet.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;intergenerational+conflict&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Intergenerational conflict<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films that contain problematic or antagonistic relations between characters of different generations, including ageing characters.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;friendship+betrayal&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Friendship betrayal<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films that contain friendship betrayal experienced by one or more aged characters, who once shared the same principles, which were, then, in the course of time abandoned for one reason or the other.</li></ul> <h4>Love in later life</h4> <ul><li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;marriage&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Marriage<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films portraying an ageing couple bonded by a civil or religious institution.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;partnership&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Partnership<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films portraying an ageing stable couple not officially bonded by a civil or religious institution.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;romance&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Romance<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films portraying a romantic relationship between two people, of which at least one is an ageing character, that is recently started, is casual or is not stable.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;separation&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Separation<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films portraying the process of breaking up a long-standing relationship between an ageing couple.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;marriage+counselling&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Marriage counselling<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: This tag applies to films in which couples of Third and Fourth Age are involved in mediating or therapeutic process aimed at repairing their marriage in crisis.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;infidelity&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Infidelity<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: This tag applies to films that present narrative lines triggered by or centred on the betrayal of spousal fidelity suffered from or perpetrated by an elderly character towards his or her romantic partner.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;widowhood&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Widowhood<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: This tag applies to films that present a character who has lost their partner, wife or husband after a relationship of significant duration.

Cultural memory is “the interplay of present and past in socio-cultural contexts” (Erll 2008:2). In Erll’s view, such an understanding of the term allows for an inclusion of a broad spectrum of phenomena as possible objects of cultural memory studies – ranging from individual acts of remembering in a social context to group memory (of family, friends, veterans, etc.) to national memory with its ‘invented traditions’ and finally to the host of transnational lieux de memoire such as the Holocaust and 9/11. (Erll, 2008: 2). The provided definitions of cultural memory are to be seen as a springboard to accommodate and intersect with the understanding of popular culture.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;personal+memory&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Personal memory<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Film depicting characters consumed by their personal memories.

Collective trauma usually refers to traumas rooted in oppression or discrimination toward a minority group by a dominant group, in contrast to interpersonal trauma. However, the term, collective trauma, is sometimes used to include environmental disasters, violence (e.g., school shootings), and pandemics that affect people across different communities. Therefore, collective trauma refers to both traumatic interpersonal interactions between the minority and majority group members, such as gender-based violence, micro-(for example, insults), and macro-aggressions (e.g., hate crimes), and governmental and non-governmental systems perpetuating discrimination, war, political and religious persecution, trafficking, and torture.” (American Psychological Association) This definition is to be expanded with the understanding of memories of culturally traumatic events, transnational lieux de memoire such as the Holocaust, 9/11 as understood by Pierre Nora.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;legacy&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Legacy<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films about the nostalgic feeling of the passing of time and the disappearing of generations/traditions (i.e.: Asja: peer-pressure from the dead).</li></ul> <h4>Setting</h4> <ul><li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;urban&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Urban<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films depicting urban location(s), involving representative city or town spaces and places (e.g. crowded streets, airports, shopping malls, emblematic images of a certain city/town) in relation to ageing characters.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;rural&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Rural<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films depicting rural location(s), involving the representative spaces and places of the village (e.g. agricultural lands, communal spaces of the community, in the case of EE that would be churches and pubs) in relation to ageing characters.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;natural&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Natural<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films depicting natural locations (mountains, rivers, caves, deserts, the sea, etc.) that are not incorporated into urban or rural locations (e.g. parks) but are in the open and are represented in relation to ageing characters.</li></ul> <h4>Housing</h4> <ul><li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;independent+home&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Independent home<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films depicting elderly characters living in a private residence, alone, with a partner, and/or with people from their own (blood or chosen) family.</li> <li><strong><a href="/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;communal+housing&quot;]}#skij"><!--[--><!---->Communal housing<!----><!--]--></a><!----></strong>: Films depicting elderly characters sharing part of their living spaces with people outside their families.

Therefore, collective trauma refers to both traumatic interpersonal interactions between the minority and majority group members, such as gender-based violence, micro-(for example, insults), and macro-aggressions (e.g., hate crimes), and governmental and non-governmental systems perpetuating discrimination, war, political and religious persecution, trafficking, and torture.” (American Psychological Association) This definition is to be expanded with the understanding of memories of culturally traumatic events, transnational lieux de memoire such as the Holocaust, 9/11 as understood by Pierre Nora.\u003C/li> \u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;legacy&quot;]}#skij\">\u003C!--[-->\u003C!---->Legacy\u003C!---->\u003C!--]-->\u003C/a>\u003C!---->\u003C/strong>: Films about the nostalgic feeling of the passing of time and the disappearing of generations/traditions (i.e.: Asja: peer-pressure from the dead).\u003C/li>\u003C/ul> \u003Ch4>Setting\u003C/h4> \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;urban&quot;]}#skij\">\u003C!--[-->\u003C!---->Urban\u003C!---->\u003C!--]-->\u003C/a>\u003C!---->\u003C/strong>: Films depicting urban location(s), involving representative city or town spaces and places (e.g. crowded streets, airports, shopping malls, emblematic images of a certain city/town) in relation to ageing characters.\u003C/li> \u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;rural&quot;]}#skij\">\u003C!--[-->\u003C!---->Rural\u003C!---->\u003C!--]-->\u003C/a>\u003C!---->\u003C/strong>: Films depicting rural location(s), involving the representative spaces and places of the village (e.g. agricultural lands, communal spaces of the community, in the case of EE that would be churches and pubs) in relation to ageing characters.\u003C/li> \u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;natural&quot;]}#skij\">\u003C!--[-->\u003C!---->Natural\u003C!---->\u003C!--]-->\u003C/a>\u003C!---->\u003C/strong>: Films depicting natural locations (mountains, rivers, caves, deserts, the sea, etc.) that are not incorporated into urban or rural locations (e.g. parks) but are in the open and are represented in relation to ageing characters.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul> \u003Ch4>Housing\u003C/h4> \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;independent+home&quot;]}#skij\">\u003C!--[-->\u003C!---->Independent home\u003C!---->\u003C!--]-->\u003C/a>\u003C!---->\u003C/strong>: Films depicting elderly characters living in a private residence, alone, with a partner, and/or with people from their own (blood or chosen) family.\u003C/li> \u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;communal+housing&quot;]}#skij\">\u003C!--[-->\u003C!---->Communal housing\u003C!---->\u003C!--]-->\u003C/a>\u003C!---->\u003C/strong>: Films depicting elderly characters sharing part of their living spaces with people outside their families.

Collective trauma usually refers to traumas rooted in oppression or discrimination toward a minority group by a dominant group, in contrast to interpersonal trauma. However, the term, collective trauma, is sometimes used to include environmental disasters, violence (e.g., school shootings), and pandemics that affect people across different communities. Therefore, collective trauma refers to both traumatic interpersonal interactions between the minority and majority group members, such as gender-based violence, micro-(for example, insults), and macro-aggressions (e.g., hate crimes), and governmental and non-governmental systems perpetuating discrimination, war, political and religious persecution, trafficking, and torture.” (American Psychological Association) This definition is to be expanded with the understanding of memories of culturally traumatic events, transnational lieux de memoire such as the Holocaust, 9/11 as understood by Pierre Nora.\u003C/li> \u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;legacy&quot;]}#skij\">\u003C!--[-->\u003C!---->Legacy\u003C!---->\u003C!--]-->\u003C/a>\u003C!---->\u003C/strong>: Films about the nostalgic feeling of the passing of time and the disappearing of generations/traditions (i.e.: Asja: peer-pressure from the dead).\u003C/li>\u003C/ul> \u003Ch4>Setting\u003C/h4> \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;urban&quot;]}#skij\">\u003C!--[-->\u003C!---->Urban\u003C!---->\u003C!--]-->\u003C/a>\u003C!---->\u003C/strong>: Films depicting urban location(s), involving representative city or town spaces and places (e.g. crowded streets, airports, shopping malls, emblematic images of a certain city/town) in relation to ageing characters.\u003C/li> \u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;rural&quot;]}#skij\">\u003C!--[-->\u003C!---->Rural\u003C!---->\u003C!--]-->\u003C/a>\u003C!---->\u003C/strong>: Films depicting rural location(s), involving the representative spaces and places of the village (e.g. agricultural lands, communal spaces of the community, in the case of EE that would be churches and pubs) in relation to ageing characters.\u003C/li> \u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;natural&quot;]}#skij\">\u003C!--[-->\u003C!---->Natural\u003C!---->\u003C!--]-->\u003C/a>\u003C!---->\u003C/strong>: Films depicting natural locations (mountains, rivers, caves, deserts, the sea, etc.) that are not incorporated into urban or rural locations (e.g. parks) but are in the open and are represented in relation to ageing characters.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul> \u003Ch4>Housing\u003C/h4> \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;independent+home&quot;]}#skij\">\u003C!--[-->\u003C!---->Independent home\u003C!---->\u003C!--]-->\u003C/a>\u003C!---->\u003C/strong>: Films depicting elderly characters living in a private residence, alone, with a partner, and/or with people from their own (blood or chosen) family.\u003C/li> \u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/?filters={&quot;tags&quot;%3A[&quot;communal+housing&quot;]}#skij\">\u003C!--[-->\u003C!---->Communal housing\u003C!---->\u003C!--]-->\u003C/a>\u003C!---->\u003C/strong>: Films depicting elderly characters sharing part of their living spaces with people outside their families.
