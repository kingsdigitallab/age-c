Each tag in the dataset identifies:

- an attribute associated to an aging character in the film, or;
- a plot device used in films dealing with ageing, or;
- a theme emerging in the film's narrative, or;
- a broader socio-cultural issue the film engages with.

When more than one tag is to be associated to a film or to a character in the
film, multiple tags have been added in the dataset.

Expanding this definition, here, elderhood may be applied to films in which an elderly group forms a specific bond based on shared experiences related to ageing and/or cultural and collective memories.

- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="Theme:::Relationships:::Friendship+%26+bonding:::non-human+companionship">Non-human companionship</FilterLink>**: As Richard Grusin affirmed, "the nonhuman turn more generally, is engaged in decentering the human in favor of a turn toward and concern for the nonhuman, understood variously in terms of animals, affectivity, bodies, organic and geophysical systems, materiality, or technologies" (2015, vii). In terms of representation and storytelling, this tag shall be applied to films portraying elderly characters accompanied by non-human figures (e.g. animals, plants, AIs, robots) with whom the elderly will form a special friendship.

### Time & Space

#### Memory

- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="Theme:::Time+%26+Space:::Memory:::cultural+memory">Cultural memory</FilterLink>**: Films engaging with the notion of cultural memory, mostly through characters' experiences of the troubled past. Cultural memory is "the interplay of present and past in socio-cultural contexts" (Erll 2008:2). In Erll's view, such an understanding of the term allows for an inclusion of a broad spectrum of phenomena as possible objects of cultural memory studies – ranging from individual acts of remembering in a social context to group memory (of family, friends, veterans, etc.) to national memory with its 'invented traditions' and finally to the host of transnational lieux de memoire such as the Holocaust and 9/11. (Erll, 2008: 2). The provided definitions of cultural memory are to be seen as a springboard to accommodate and intersect with the understanding of popular culture.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="Theme:::Time+%26+Space:::Memory:::personal+memory">Personal memory</FilterLink>**: Film depicting characters consumed by their personal memories. Personal or autobiographical memory. "Autobiographical memory refers to memory of personal experiences and facts about the self" (Conway, 2005; Rubin, 2005).
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="Theme:::Time+%26+Space:::Memory:::personal+trauma">Personal trauma</FilterLink>**: Films engaging with the notion of trauma, mostly through characters' past traumatic experience. "In the most general definition, trauma describes an overwhelming experience of sudden or delayed, uncontrolled repetitive appearance of hallucinations and other intrusive phenomena" (Caruth 1996:11). "trauma is not locatable in the simple violent or original event in an individual's past, but rather in the way that its very unassimilated nature - the way it was precisely not known in the first instance - return to haunt the survivor later on" (Caruth, 1996:4) Both definitions are meant to engage with a notion of personal trauma.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="Theme:::Time+%26+Space:::Memory:::collective+trauma">Collective trauma</FilterLink>**: Films engaging with the notion of collective trauma. "Collective trauma is an event or series of events that impact not only one person but also a group of identified or targeted people. Collective trauma usually refers to traumas rooted in oppression or discrimination toward a minority group by a dominant group, in contrast to interpersonal trauma. However, the term, collective trauma, is sometimes used to include environmental disasters, violence (e.g., school shootings), and pandemics that affect people across different communities. Therefore, collective trauma refers to both traumatic interpersonal interactions between the minority and majority group members, such as gender-based violence, micro-(for example, insults), and macro-aggressions (e.g., hate crimes), and governmental and non-governmental systems perpetuating discrimination, war, political and religious persecution, trafficking, and torture." (American Psychological Association) This definition is to be expanded with the understanding of memories of culturally traumatic events, transnational lieux de memoire such as the Holocaust, 9/11 as understood by Pierre Nora.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="Theme:::Time+%26+Space:::Memory:::legacy">Legacy</FilterLink>**: Films about the nostalgic feeling of the passing of time and the disappearing of generations/traditions (i.e.: Asja: peer-pressure from the dead).

- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="Theme:::Time+%26+Space:::Setting:::rural">Rural</FilterLink>**: Films depicting rural location(s), involving the representative spaces and places of the village (e.g. agricultural lands, communal spaces of the community, in the case of EE that would be churches and pubs) in relation to ageing characters.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="Theme:::Time+%26+Space:::Setting:::natural">Natural</FilterLink>**: Films depicting natural locations (mountains, rivers, caves, deserts, the sea, etc.) that are not incorporated into urban or rural locations (e.g. parks) but are in the open and are represented in relation to ageing characters.

#### Housing

- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="Theme:::Time+%26+Space:::Housing:::independent+home">Independent home</FilterLink>**: Films depicting elderly characters living in a private residence, alone, with a partner, and/or with people from their own (blood or chosen) family.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="Theme:::Time+%26+Space:::Housing:::communal+housing">Communal housing</FilterLink>**: Films depicting elderly characters sharing part of their living spaces with people outside their families. This may stem from a conscious decision to communalise material and immaterial resources, and/or to explore unconventional forms of social organisation.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="Theme:::Time+%26+Space:::Housing:::retirement+home">Retirement home</FilterLink>**: Films depicting elderly characters living in a retirement home/care home.
