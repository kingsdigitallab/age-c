Each tag in the dataset identifies:

- an attribute associated to an aging character in the film, or;
- a plot device used in films dealing with ageing, or;
- a theme emerging in the film's narrative, or;
- a broader socio-cultural issue the film engages with.

When more than one tag is to be associated to a film or to a character in the
film, multiple tags have been added in the dataset.

(WHO, 2015). "This definition captures the idea that disability isn't about issues related to individual function alone but also about the ways in which the environment can help or hinder, thereby 'disabling' a person or creating unnecessary barriers" (De Medeiros, 2017: 81).
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="physical+illness">Physical Illness</FilterLink>**: Films depicting ageing characters affected by physical illness or disorder. As opposed to mental illness, this is a relatively poorly researched term and is not mentioned in the WHO's International Classification of Disease.

"A mental disorder is characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behaviour.

Mental disorders may also be referred to as mental health conditions. The latter is a broader term covering mental disorders, psychosocial disabilities and (other) mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm" (WHO, 2022).
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="substance+abuse">Substance Abuse</FilterLink>**: Films depicting ageing characters engaging in or affected by substance abuse. "As used in this discussion, substance abuse refers to excessive use of a drug in a way that is detrimental to self, society, or both. This definition includes both physical dependence and psychologic dependence." (Walker HK, Hall WD, Hurst JW, editors., 1990).
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="menopause">Menopause</FilterLink>**: Films depicting ageing women in the stage of life marked by menopause. "For women, the cultural dichotomy of youth and old age has long been underwritten by the biological dividing line between the reproductive and post-reproductive years, with the symbolic date of older age for women understood as coinciding with menopause around the age of 50." (Woodward, 168).

#### Care

- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="caregiving">Caregiving</FilterLink>**: Films depicting the act of caring for or by an ageing character. This may take place either in a caring facility (hospital, hospice, nursing home) or in a different environment (such as at home).

According to Britannica, Artificial Intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. (Britannica).

#### Friendship & bonding

- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="homosociality">Homosociality</FilterLink>**: Originally derived from the field of sociology, homosociality entails same-sex relationships that are not romantic or sexual. The literature generally uses the term to describe male homosociality as one of the upholders of male dominance in society. Nevertheless, homosociality in this dataset may equally refer to films portraying same-sex friendship/bonding between females or males.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="elderhood">Elderhood (friendship among elders)</FilterLink>**: Following its dictionary definition, elderhood means the state, quality, or condition of being an elder. Expanding this definition, here, elderhood may be applied to films in which an elderly group forms a specific bond based on shared experiences related to ageing and/or cultural and collective memories. As opposed to the concept of homosociality, elderhood mainly focuses on sharing a similar age and not necessarily the same gender.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="intragenerational+friendship">Intragenerational friendship</FilterLink>**: This tag can be applied to films in which a relationship of friendship between two elderly people is portrayed and thematised. The relationship would take place between two elderly people of similar age group and regardless of gender (although if it is between two ageing people of the same sex it can be combined with homosociality).
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="intergenerational+friendship">Intergenerational friendship</FilterLink>**: This tag may be applied to films in which an intergenerational friendship between people that are not related by blood is portrayed, the elderly person being a mandatory component in this relationship. Friendship(s) between kids, teenagers, young adults or middle-aged and the elderly shall be considered.

- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="non-human+companionship">Non-human companionship</FilterLink>**: As Richard Grusin affirmed, "the nonhuman turn more generally, is engaged in decentering the human in favor of a turn toward and concern for the nonhuman, understood variously in terms of animals, affectivity, bodies, organic and geophysical systems, materiality, or technologies" (2015, vii). In terms of representation and storytelling, this tag shall be applied to films portraying elderly characters accompanied by non-human figures (e.g. animals, plants, AIs, robots) with whom the elderly will form a special friendship.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="mentorship">Mentorship</FilterLink>**: This tag may be applied to films in which a mentorship is formed between an elderly and a younger character, the elderly character generally representing the holder of wisdom and valuable life experiences that the younger character does not posses yet.

- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="widowhood">Widowhood</FilterLink>**: This tag applies to films that present a character who has lost their partner, wife or husband after a relationship of significant duration. It should be applied only when the loss is explicitly mentioned in the film.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="celibacy">Celibacy</FilterLink>**: This tag applies to films that present a character who is not involved in a casual or stable romantic relationship throughout the entire narrative. The character should not be significantly affected by this situation, nor actively try to change it. In other words, they are experiencing their singlehood serenely.

- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="abuse">Abuse</FilterLink>**: Films portraying the exercise of physical, psychological or symbolic violence between two or more people, of which at least one is an ageing character, as victim or perpetrator.

### Time & Space

#### Memory

- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="cultural+memory">Cultural memory</FilterLink>**: Films engaging with the notion of cultural memory, mostly through characters' experiences of the troubled past. Cultural memory is "the interplay of present and past in socio-cultural contexts" (Erll 2008:2). In Erll's view, such an understanding of the term allows for an inclusion of a broad spectrum of phenomena as possible objects of cultural memory studies – ranging from individual acts of remembering in a social context to group memory (of family, friends, veterans, etc.) to national memory with its 'invented traditions' and finally to the host of transnational lieux de memoire such as the Holocaust and 9/11. (Erll, 2008: 2). The provided definitions of cultural memory are to be seen as a springboard to accommodate and intersect with the understanding of popular culture.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="personal+memory">Personal memory</FilterLink>**: Film depicting characters consumed by their personal memories. Personal or autobiographical memory. "Autobiographical memory refers to memory of personal experiences and facts about the self" (Conway, 2005; Rubin, 2005).
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="personal+trauma">Personal trauma</FilterLink>**: Films engaging with the notion of trauma, mostly through characters' past traumatic experience. "In the most general definition, trauma describes an overwhelming experience of sudden or delayed, uncontrolled repetitive appearance of hallucinations and other intrusive phenomena" (Caruth 1996:11). "trauma is not locatable in the simple violent or original event in an individual's past, but rather in the way that its very unassimilated nature - the way it was precisely not known in the first instance - return to haunt the survivor later on" (Caruth, 1996:4) Both definitions are meant to engage with a notion of personal trauma.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="collective+trauma">Collective trauma</FilterLink>**: Films engaging with the notion of collective trauma. "Collective trauma is an event or series of events that impact not only one person but also a group of identified or targeted people. Collective trauma usually refers to traumas rooted in oppression or discrimination toward a minority group by a dominant group, in contrast to interpersonal trauma. However, the term, collective trauma, is sometimes used to include environmental disasters, violence (e.g., school shootings), and pandemics that affect people across different communities. Therefore, collective trauma refers to both traumatic interpersonal interactions between the minority and majority group members, such as gender-based violence, micro-(for example, insults), and macro-aggressions (e.g., hate crimes), and governmental and non-governmental systems perpetuating discrimination, war, political and religious persecution, trafficking, and torture." (American Psychological Association) This definition is to be expanded with the understanding of memories of culturally traumatic events, transnational lieux de memoire such as the Holocaust, 9/11 as understood by Pierre Nora.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="legacy">Legacy</FilterLink>**: Films about the nostalgic feeling of the passing of time and the disappearing of generations/traditions (i.e.: Asja: peer-pressure from the dead).

#### Setting

- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="urban">Urban</FilterLink>**: Films depicting urban location(s), involving representative city or town spaces and places (e.g. crowded streets, airports, shopping malls, emblematic images of a certain city/town) in relation to ageing characters.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="rural">Rural</FilterLink>**: Films depicting rural location(s), involving the representative spaces and places of the village (e.g. agricultural lands, communal spaces of the community, in the case of EE that would be churches and pubs) in relation to ageing characters.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="natural">Natural</FilterLink>**: Films depicting natural locations (mountains, rivers, caves, deserts, the sea, etc.) that are not incorporated into urban or rural locations (e.g. parks) but are in the open and are represented in relation to ageing characters.

#### Housing

- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="independent+home">Independent home</FilterLink>**: Films depicting elderly characters living in a private residence, alone, with a partner, and/or with people from their own (blood or chosen) family.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="communal+housing">Communal housing</FilterLink>**: Films depicting elderly characters sharing part of their living spaces with people outside their families. This may stem from a conscious decision to communalise material and immaterial resources, and/or to explore unconventional forms of social organisation.
- **<FilterLink name="tags" value="retirement+home">Retirement home</FilterLink>**: Films depicting elderly characters living in a retirement home/care home. Retirement homes offer residences to elderly individuals and couples who are mostly able to care for themselves.
