This is an accessibility statement from King's Digital Lab.

## Assessment approach

King's Digital Lab assessed the accessibility of this website using the following
approaches:

- Self-evaluation using [Webval](https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/webval),
  a web application that uses [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/),
  [HTML_CodeSniffer](https://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/) and
  [Axe accessibility tools](https://www.deque.com/axe/) to report and
  validate accessibility
- [Add link to Evaluation report]({base})
- Manual testing of the site by the King's Digital Lab team

## Limitations and alternatives

Despite our best efforts to ensure accessibility, there may be areas where
accessibility is limited. Below is a description of known issues, and potential
solutions. Please contact us if you observe an issue not listed below.

### Known limitations for AGE-C

1. **Data visualisation** : The site includes data visualisations in SVG format,
   which are not accessible to users of screen readers. We provide both aria
   labels and a data table for each visualisation.

1. **Content** : Content is added regularly by project partners and may not have
   yet been tested for accessibility. When we run an accessibility tool on the
   content we will notify project partners to fix any issues.

## Feedback

We welcome your feedback on the accessibility of AGE-C. Please let us know
if you encounter barriers to accessibility and we will investigate how to address these:

## Measures to support accessibility

King's Digital Lab takes the following measures to ensure accessibility:

- Include commitment to accessibility as part of our values;
- The King's Digital Lab team regularly tests its online services and systems
  to ensure they meet accessibility requirements when covered by a Service Level
  Agreement. We aim to comply with
  [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
  2.1 AA at minimum when feasible.

## Conformance status

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements to improve
accessibility for people with disabilities.
It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.
The project is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Partially conformant
means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility
standard.

## Technical specifications

Accessibility of the website relies on the following technologies to work with
the particular combination of web browser and any assistive technologies or
plugins installed on your computer:

- HTML
- WAI-ARIA
- CSS
- JavaScript

These technologies are relied upon for conformance with the accessibility
standards used.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement

This statement is a work in progress.
