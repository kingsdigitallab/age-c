    "english": "Domingo Domingo is an extroverted and go-getter farmer. In English, his name would be \"Sunday Sunday.\" He is addicted to life and therefore doesn't know how to live without adrenaline. Now he has a new obsession: oranges. However, he knows that oranges don't belong to farmers anymore. The big corporations have started to patent the best varieties of oranges and are forcing the farmers to buy them. But Domingo is not one of those who surrender the fight. In fact, he believes he can play the same game... He has a perfect secret plan: a hidden tree with a new variety of oranges. Domingo will get the first oranges from his secret tree in a year. Will he be able to patent it and confront the multinationals? In this battle against Goliath, Domingo has plenty of ingenuity and good humor to succeed, in order to enjoy every day of his life like it was a Sunday."
