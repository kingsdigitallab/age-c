His older brother, Quentin, already lives there; his parents will take care of everything. It\u2019ll be nice. And then, one day, a sudden tragedy strips away everything Lucas took for granted, leaving him filled with anger and despair, his future in shambles. Quentin is lost in his own pain. Their mother, Isabelle, doesn\u2019t know how to reach out to the young man Lucas is becoming. And so he is left to find his way alone, seeking comfort in a Paris that is still recovering from the pandemic."
