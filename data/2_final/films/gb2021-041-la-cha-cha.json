  "synopsis": {
    "native": "Solti Buttering (Liam Hourican) is on a road trip to scatter his grandfathers ashes. Finding everywhere closed, he stumbles across La Cha Cha, a holiday park with a community of retired characters, living off grid and having the time of their lives. He soon discovers that feisty owner Libby Rees (Ruby Ashbourne Serkis) and her brother Damien (Sonny Ashbourne Serkis) are struggling to keep the place, and community, going. But they have a very unusual plan."
