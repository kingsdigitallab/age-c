    "native": "Lucy, a disillusioned office clerk who lives in a dysfunctional relationship with her slovenly partner Paul, is surprised to find herself on the cusp of a none-too-secret affair with her new work colleague, Daniel. The thrill of the chase for a shred of affection takes her mind off her problematic life but she's not sure that she'll ever leave Paul, or that sex with someone else is the true answer to her problems."
