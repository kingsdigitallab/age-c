  "synopsis":"S\u00e8te, 1994. Amin, apprenti sc\u00e9nariste install\u00e9 \u00e0 Paris, retourne un \u00e9t\u00e9 dans sa ville natale, pour retrouver famille et amis d\u2019enfance. Accompagn\u00e9 de son cousin Tony et de sa meilleure amie Oph\u00e9lie, Amin passe son temps entre le restaurant de sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s tunisiennes tenu par ses parents, les bars de quartier, et la plage fr\u00e9quent\u00e9e par les filles en vacances. Fascin\u00e9 par les nombreuses figures f\u00e9minines qui l\u2019entourent, Amin reste en retrait et contemple ces sir\u00e8nes de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, contrairement \u00e0 son cousin qui se jette dans l\u2019ivresse des corps. Mais quand vient le temps d\u2019aimer, seul le destin - le mektoub - peut d\u00e9cider.",
  "synopsisEn":"It's the end of summer vacation for Amin. The young photographer spends cozy evenings with Charlotte, the ex-girlfriend of his Casanova cousin. She talks to him about literature, he photographs her. Nobody knows that they see each other, especially not Oph\u00e9lie, his childhood friend, who instead confides her troubles to Amin: her father wants her to take over the family farm, her fianc\u00e9 Clement will return soon from Iraq for their wedding, she is pregnant with Tony\u2019s baby, and Tony wants to keep their affair secret instead of having a serious relationship. Oph\u00e9lie constantly contemplates her choices: would it be better to get an abortion in secret and marry Clement or to follow her maternal instinct and keep the child, perhaps seeking refuge with Amin in Paris? Meanwhile, Tony introduces Amin to an American producer at his summer home who wants to produce Amin\u2019s screenplay and give his wife Jessica the main role. This encounter is Amin's chance to break into the movie business, his biggest dream. Jessica lives in a gilded cage, with a powerful husband who oppresses her, directing her everyday life and controlling her body by making her diet. Like Oph\u00e9lie, she also must choose: continue this life or take flight. Between Amin's encounters with these women and his dreams of cinema, many choices open up to him. Destiny will have to decide his path.",
