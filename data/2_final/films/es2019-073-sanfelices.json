    "english": "Manuel is a young student whose life completely changes when his mother Elena, has a stroke. He stops going out with friends, abandons his studies and starts working to pay for the care center where she's admitted. After a relapse, Elena travels with her son to San Felices, the village where she first worked as a teacher, where she fell in love for the first time, where Manuel was born, where she was happy... and where she has never returned to until now. It is there that they rekindle the profound love that they feel for each other, but the moment to answer the questions her son has asked her all these years also comes."
