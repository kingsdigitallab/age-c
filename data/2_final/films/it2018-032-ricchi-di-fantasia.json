Everything seems to change when Sergio's colleagues take revenge for his jokes, making him believe that he won 3 million euros in the lottery. Convinced that he has become rich, Sergio decides to abandon his old life bringing with him not only Sabrina, but also their relatives. When Sergio and Sabrina discover that there is no winnings, they decide not to reveal it to anyone and drag their families on a journey from the Roman outskirts to Puglia. But the truth always comes to the surface and the tensions between such different characters are destined to explode."
