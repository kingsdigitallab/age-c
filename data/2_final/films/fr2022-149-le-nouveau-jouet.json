To provide for the needs of his future family \u2013 very reluctantly \u2013 he takes a job as a night watchman in a luxury goods store. Philippe Etienne is the wealthiest man in France. Cold, unfeeling, since his wife died a year ago, he has devoted himself entirely to his business. Alexandre \u2013 his only son, and heir to the entire Etienne fortune \u2013 keeps his father at arms\u2019 length, seeking refuge in the lonely world of the spoiled child. For his birthday, Philippe opens the toy department of the store where Samy works and tells Alexandre he can take whatever he wants. Alexandre chooses Samy!"
