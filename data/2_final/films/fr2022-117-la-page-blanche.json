    "english": "When Eloise wakes up, she has no memories of her past. Her friends, her job, her family, her life: she truly is a mystery to herself. Patching a few pieces together, Eloise manages to find her flat and her job. However, with no recollection of who she was, she finds herself navigating someone else life. As the days go, Eloise discovers who she was and is not fond of it. Eloise realizes her amnesia is an opportunity. It is time for a fresh start!"
