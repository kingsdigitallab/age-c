    "english": "Straight-laced shrink Romain is fascinated by his new psych ward patient L\u00e9o Milan, who claims to be a highly-trained international spy, code-named \u201cThe Lion\u201d. But of course, that\u2019s just crazy talk, right? Maybe not. When Romain\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is kidnapped before his very eyes, just as The Lion predicted, Romain realizes that L\u00e9o is the only one who seems to know what\u2019s going on. And only he has the skills to rescue her. Desperate, Romain breaks out The Lion and does his best to keep up with him, in a frantic chase across Paris to rescue Louise and protect France\u2019s central bank from the heist of the century."
