    "native": "Le operaie di una fabbrica del Nordest, che produce lingerie, stanno per essere licenziate. Poco lontano, un pugno di suore, abili nell\u2019arte del ricamo e devote alla Beata Armida, rischiano di essere allontanate dall\u2019amato convento.

To oppose an already marked destiny, workers and nuns undertake a unique \"for-profit\" collaboration: an artisanal and clandestine production of lingerie. Very embroidered and quite sexy..."
