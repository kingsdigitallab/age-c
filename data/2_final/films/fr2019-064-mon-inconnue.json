    "english":"When Raphael first met Olivia in high school, it was love at first sight. After 10 years of happy marriage and a thriving career as a bestselling author, Raphael has it all \u2013 or so he thinks. After a huge argument between the couple, Raphael wakes up in parallel life as an unmarried, ping pong playing, middle-school teacher who\u2019s been glued to his childhood best friend for a little too long. Realizing Olivia was his everything, he must go above and beyond to win back the love of his life \u2013 who in this world has absolutely no idea who he is."
