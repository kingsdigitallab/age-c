    "english": "Carlo, a young music composer from a wealthy family, is going through an emotional crisis. When he moves to a new house he recalls the events and factors that led to his condition: the moment he met Maria, his first marriage, his obsession with music, his marriage, infidelity and the consequences of it. While the past returns in the form of memories, Carlo fights to recover his life and desire to compose music. Dolorosa Gioia tells the story of the tragic life of Renaissance music composer Carlo Gesualdo, although the story is set in the present."
