Zehn verschiedene Visa, die Rolle als Ausl\u00e4nder und sein immer noch holpriges Deutsch hat er als Teil seiner Geschichte akzeptiert. Doch ist er so weit?",
        "english": "Dar\u00edo Aguirre moved from Ecuador to Germany to be with Stephanie, but from the very first day there was a third party in their relationship:the government. They issued him ten visas in fifteen years. A long trail of papers, stamps, permits, and restrictions connected Dar\u00edo to Germany while also keeping him at a distance. Then one fine day the mayor of Hamburg invites Dar\u00edo to become a German citizen. A confession of love? Dar\u00edo responds with a tender, ironic road movie that traces his intertwined journey from the country of his fathers to the country of his children."
