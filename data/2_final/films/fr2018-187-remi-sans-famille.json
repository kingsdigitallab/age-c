  "synopsisEn":"Raised by a kindly peasant woman after being found as a baby, ten-year-old Remi is brutally taken from his adopted mother and sold by her husband to Signor Vitalis, an old travelling street musician with a shadowy past. Remi sets off on a long journey through France with his new master, their faithful dog Capi and mischievous monkey Mister Joli-C\u0153ur. From adventures to misadventures, young Remi endears himself to Vitalis, who teaches him to read and helps him discover his extraordinary singing talent. The boy learns the rough life of a travelling showman and suffers through hunger, cold and sometimes great injustice. He also learns life, makes great friends and gains a mentor and father in Vitalis. But when the clothes he was found in as an infant and a mysterious lullaby from his distant past bring him closer to his origins, Remi is suddenly faced with a new set of challenges that could reveal his true identity and change forever the course of his young life.",
