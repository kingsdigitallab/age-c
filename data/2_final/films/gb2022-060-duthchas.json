  "synopsis":"For many of us there are two places we can call home - where we were born, where we still feel we belong, and where we now live. This film is about the yearning for their birth home felt by those who have left the Isle of Berneray in the Outer Hebrides, and the remembrance of the ever-living past for those who have stayed or returned, when the home in their heart is also where they live.",
