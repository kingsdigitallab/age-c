    "english": "Marilou and Philippe are finally retired! They cannot wait to move to Portugal. At last, they will have time for themselves. They just have to sell their house and tell their family about the move. What should be a formality turns into quite a challenge. The couple\u2019s daughter keeps asking them to babysit, her husband squats their house and Patrick\u2019s mother needs constant care. Marilou and Philippe cannot find the time nor the courage to make their announcement and keep postponing their departure. They should have known you cannot escape your family so easily..."
