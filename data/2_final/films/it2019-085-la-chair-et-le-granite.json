  "synopsis": {
    "english": "Shelomo Selinger, ninety years old, is carving a monument dedicated to the victims of the Shoah. Like the statue emerging from the granite, his memories, too, emerge, fragmented, inlaid between History and the personal experiences of Shelomo, who was a first-hand witness to the events. His son Rami, who is a plastic surgeon, and Pierre Abramovici, a historian and family friend, guide us on this journey made of history and art, between the need to remember and the need to forget."
