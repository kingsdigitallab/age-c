  "synopsis":{
    "native":"The Felling tells the true story of a small group of residents in Sheffield who battled to stop a powerful city council and a giant multinational corporation from chopping down thousands of healthy street trees as part of a massive \u00a32.2 billion private contract to maintain the city's highways. What started as innocent local protest, turned into a nightmare, attracting national and international support. As the stakes increased with threats of bankruptcy and imprisonment, ordinary citizens were forced to ask themselves the crucial question: How far am I prepared to go to save a tree? Filmed over 2 years, this is an extraordinary and shocking first-hand account of what happened on the tree-lined suburban streets of Sheffield.",
