  "synopsis": {
    "native": "David, jeune paysan du Cantal, vient d\u2019avoir une id\u00e9e : pour sauver son exploitation de la faillite, il va monter un cabaret \u00e0 la ferme. Le spectacle sera sur sc\u00e8ne et dans l\u2019assiette, avec les bons produits du coin. Il en est s\u00fbr, \u00e7a ne peut que marcher ! Ses proches, sa m\u00e8re et surtout son grand-p\u00e8re, sont plus sceptiques.",
    "english": "Hard work and big ideas aren't enough. David's dairy farm is on the brink of liquidation. When he chances upon a dazzling nightclub performance by Bonnie Starlight, inspiration strikes. What if he turned his big old barn into a country cabaret? Not just for entertainment, but to promote local food producers, including his mother's delicious cheese. A crazy plan, for sure - which is exactly why he loves it! David has to convince sophisticated \u201cCity Girl\u201d Bonnie to live in a converted barn loft out in the middle of nowhere and work around the clock to make a great show out of nothing. Finding local talent is no small feat either, but together they manage to assemble a zany cast of characters and create a troupe. Through blood sweat and tears, and a whole lot of laughs, they not only build a great stage and get their act together, they also learn a thing or two about themselves and each other. Everything seems on track for the big opening night, until David's traditionalist grandpa steps in, hell-bent on putting an end to their follies. Can they save the show and save the farm?"
