To Zoe, nothing beats being with horses, especially her \u00ab best friend \u00bb Beautiful Intrigue, the stable\u2019s prize mare, who taught the child how to walk. When Beautiful Intrigue gives birth to a foal that Zoe names Tempest, the girl is the first to see in him the champion her parents have been waiting and working for all their lives. The winner she will ride to victory. But Zoe\u2019s dreams are shattered one stormy night, when a panicked Tempest accidentally injures the girl, leaving her permanently \u201cdisabled\u201d. Furious at life, Zoe slips into despair and pulls her entire family down with her, especially her father, who is on the verge of losing everything. But with the indefectible support of her family and the help of Seb, a stable hand with a gift for communicating with horses, Zoe will seek to conquer the impossible, in pursuit of her dream.",
