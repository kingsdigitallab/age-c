    "native": "Maria est femme de m\u00e9nage. Mari\u00e9e depuis 25 ans, r\u00e9serv\u00e9e, timide et maladroite, elle ne quitte jamais son carnet \u00e0 fleurs dans lequel elle \u00e9crit des po\u00e8mes en secret. Lorsqu\u2019elle est affect\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, elle rencontre Hubert, le gardien fantasque de l'\u00e9cole, et d\u00e9couvre un lieu fascinant o\u00f9 r\u00e8gnent la libert\u00e9, la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et l'audace... Dans ce monde si nouveau, Maria, qui a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9vou\u00e9e et discr\u00e8te, va-t-elle enfin se laisser envahir par la vie ?",
    "english": "Maria prides herself on hard work and devotion. Kindhearted and a little clumsy, she has always been a cleaning lady. But she has a secret passion. Hidden inside the little red book she takes everywhere are poems she writes but shares with no one, especially not with her indifferent husband. When Maria gets a job on the cleaning crew at the prestigious Paris Beaux-Arts fine arts academy, everything changes. She immediately hits it off with Hubert, the school's eccentric long-time custodian, obsessed with mastering the iconic dance moves of Elvis Presley. Hubert knows all the students and every inch of the campus by heart. Maria is amazed by the grandeur and beauty of Paris Beaux Arts. She befriends some of the students and even poses for them. As she adapts to her new job and explores the artistic world of the school, she gets herself into some tricky situations. Luckily, Hubert is always nearby to help her out! The bond that grows between them breaks through Maria's solitude, as she rediscovers herself and a world of emotion. Will she dare make the leap of faith to enjoy life and love to the fullest?"
