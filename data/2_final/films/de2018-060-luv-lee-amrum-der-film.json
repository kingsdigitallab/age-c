    "english": "The documentary film shows nature and the often slow and relaxed life on the North Sea island Amrum over the four seasons. The everyday life of the sea rescuers and lighthouse keepers is in the focus, as are the works of the beach chair man and the bird conservationists on the Amrumer Odde. The portrait of the windswept island surrounded by endless beaches also provides insight into past days, especially the storm surge in 1962, which one of Amrum's great captains, August Jakobs, reports about in his last interview."
