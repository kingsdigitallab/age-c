    "native": "Forc\u00e9 de fuir son Bangladesh natal, le jeune Fahim et son p\u00e8re quittent le reste de la famille pour Paris. D\u00e8s leur arriv\u00e9e, ils entament un v\u00e9ritable parcours du combattant pour obtenir l\u2019asile politique, avec la menace d\u2019\u00eatre expuls\u00e9s \u00e0 tout moment. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 son don pour les \u00e9checs, Fahim rencontre Sylvain, l\u2019un des meilleurs entra\u00eeneurs d\u2019\u00e9checs de France. Entre m\u00e9fiance et attirance, ils vont apprendre \u00e0 se conna\u00eetre et se lier d\u2019amiti\u00e9. Alors que le Championnat de France commence, la menace d\u2019expulsion se fait pressante et Fahim n\u2019a plus qu\u2019une seule chance pour s\u2019en sortir : \u00eatre Champion de France.",
    "english": "Forced to flee his native Bangladesh, eight year-old chess prodigy Fahim arrives in Paris with his father. Refused asylum, as illegal immigrants they spiral downwards into homelessness and desperation. By a stroke of luck, Fahim is introduced to one of France\u2019s top chess coaches, Sylvain (real name: Xavier Parmentier), who tutors him and gives him a sense of purpose - his struggles on the chessboard mirroring both his victories and his crushing defeats in his battle for a normal life. Fahim then rises through local and national tournaments only to be crowned France\u2019s Under-12 Chess Champion in 2012. The film tells the story of a child who learns to live without his mother and without his father, far from home, from his roots and his language. Fahim\u2019s tale is not only a moving account of the grim realities that underlie a supposedly caring society, but also a heartwarming testimony to a father\u2019s determination, the kindness of strangers, and one small boy\u2019s courageous will to succeed."
