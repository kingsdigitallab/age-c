Through the eyes of Antonio Citterio, one of the best-known Italian designers around the world, and Patricia Viel, co-founders of the Milan-based architecture and interior design practice ACPV, the film introduces a vision for the architecture of tomorrow, centered on an armistice between nature and the built environment"
