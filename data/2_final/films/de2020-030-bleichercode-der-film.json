    "native": "Lotti (Marion Mitterhammer) ist 48 und kehrt nach zehn Jahren in ihre Heimatstadt Bleicherode zur\u00fcck. Dock kaum angekommen, muss sie sich zun\u00e4chst einmal daf\u00fcr rechtfertigen, dass sie ihre damals sechsj\u00e4hrige Tochter einfach bei der Gro\u00dfmutter zur\u00fcckgelassen hat. Au\u00dferdem sorgt die Tatsache f\u00fcr Aufregung, dass sie in der Zwischenzeit Pornostar geworden ist. Doch erstmal will Lotti die Beziehung zu ihrer Tochter wieder kitten \u2013 auch wenn das mit der schlechten Stimmung im Dorf sehr schwer f\u00e4llt...",
    "english": "After ten years in Vienna, Lotti Funke (48) returns to her old hometown of Bleicherode in the Thuringian province. However, she is not welcomed there with open arms, which is not just because she simply left her six-year-old daughter with her old mother back then. As a bird of paradise and former porn star, Lotti's brash and flirtatious manner causes plenty of whispering and turned heads. Not all the inhabitants of Bleicherode are well-disposed towards her, which makes it difficult for her to gain a foothold and mend the broken relationship with her estranged teenage daughter. For the hit movie from Thuringia, an entire town realized its dream of making its own feature film. A declaration of love by veteran director and Fassbinder cinematographer Hans-G\u00fcnther B\u00fccking - both to his native Bleicherode and to his wife, actress Marion Mitterhammer, who embodies the titular lead role. This dazzling protagonist is surrounded by many people who are as quirky as they are likeable and who are probably in no way inferior to the \"Sch'tis\"!"
