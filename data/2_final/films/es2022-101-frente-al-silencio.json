  "synopsis":"Fuensanta \"La Moneta\" es bailaora de flamenco. En su estudio de danza prepara un nuevo espect\u00e1culo basado en el libro \"La Cabellera de la Sho\u00e1\" del poeta F\u00e9lix Grande. Decide visitar Auschwitz y enfrentarse al silencio.",
  "synopsisEn":"Fuensanta \"La Moneta\" is a contemporary flamenco dancer and choreographer. In her dance studio she prepares a new show with her students, however, everything changes when one of her students, Israeli and Jewish, gives her the book \"La Cabellera de la Sho\u00e1\" that F\u00e9lix Grande wrote during his visit to Auschwitz and that marked his work to the point of being his last book. Fuensanta devours each poem by F\u00e9lix Grande and doesn't stop thinking about those tons of accumulated hair, about the captive gypsies and the Jewish women marching towards certain death. It is then that she turns her show around and her goal is to visit Auschwitz to imbue herself with silence and look at it head-on. After convincing her manager, Ra\u00fal, she starts a retrospective in her show to mix dance, literature, music and the silent interpretation of millions of silent lives. Choosing three students in the cast will not be a comfortable task and each one will discover that \"La Cabellera de Sho\u00e1\" is a greater bond than they imagined.",
