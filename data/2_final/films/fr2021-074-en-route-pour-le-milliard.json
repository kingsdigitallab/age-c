  "synopsis": {
    "native": "1734 km sur le fleuve Congo, une incroyable \u00e9pop\u00e9e pour r\u00e9clamer justice. Sola, Modogo, Mama Kashinde, Papa Sylvain, Bozi, Pr\u00e9sident Lemalema\u2026 font partie de l\u2019Association des victimes de la Guerre des Six Jours de Kisangani. Depuis 20 ans, ils se battent pour la m\u00e9moire de ce conflit et demandent r\u00e9paration pour les pr\u00e9judices subis. Exc\u00e9d\u00e9s par l'indiff\u00e9rence des institutions \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard, ils d\u00e9cident de se rendre \u00e0 Kinshasa pour faire entendre leurs voix.",
    "english": "From June 5 to 10 of 2010, the city of Kisangani, in Democratic Republic of Congo, was the scene of fighting with heavy weapons between two Congolese rebel groups. One was allied to Uganda, the other to Rwanda. Since then, the \u00ab Victims of Six Days War Association \u00bb struggles for recognition of this bloody conflict and asks for compensations. Uganda was found guilty of \u00ab war crimes \u00bb by the International Court of Justice, but the amount of compensation is still under discussion, two decades after the offences. Tired of long years of bureaucratic wheeling and dealing, infructuous advocacy, tired of the growing indifference from their compatriots, the members of the Association decided to take charge of their own future : after a one month trip on the Congo river, they\u2019ll raise their own voice in Kinshasa, where the institutions sit and most of the former war chiefs found refuge."
