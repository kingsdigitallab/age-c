    "english": "Jacques Blanchot just lost everything : his wife, his son, his house, his work. Abandoned by all, he gets picked up by a zealous pet shop owner who, unable to see him as a friend, offers to train him as his dog. Losing foot with reality, rejected by his peers, Jacques Blanchot discovers the challenges and perks of this new life. Adapted from his own novel, Samuel Bench\u00e9trit tells us the fall of an individual with humor and self-mockery."
