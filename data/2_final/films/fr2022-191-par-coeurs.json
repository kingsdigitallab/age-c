    "english": "It's summertime, 2021. Isabelle Huppert plays Lioubov, Chekhov's unforgettably heroine in The Cherry Orchard. In a near theatre, Fabrice Luchini recites Nietzsche. Both actors are premiering at Avignon's Festival. When they leave backstage to stand out on stage, they are completely transformed. As everything seems utterly natural, audience does not imagine what happened before. By following their daily lives during the weeks preceding the premieres, Beno\u00eet Jacquot brings a singular perspective of the two actors and shows them like we've never seen before."
