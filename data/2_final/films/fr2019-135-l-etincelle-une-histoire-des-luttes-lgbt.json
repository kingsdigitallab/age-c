De San Francisco \u00e0 Paris en passant par Amsterdam, entre les premi\u00e8res Gay Pride, l\u2019\u00e9lection d\u2019Harvey Milk, la \u00ab d\u00e9p\u00e9nalisation \u00bb fran\u00e7aise, l\u2019\u00e9pid\u00e9mie du Sida et les premiers mariages homosexuels, ces quelques d\u00e9cennies de lutte s\u2019incarnent au travers de nombreux t\u00e9moignages d\u2019acteurs et actrices de cette r\u00e9volution arc-en-ciel.",
        "english": "This is a story of anger. That of the customers of the \u201cStonewall inn\u201d, in a gay bar in New-York. It\u2019s 1969 and they don\u2019t have the right to stand in the street or even dance. One more police raid. A revolt. Several days of riots. This is our starting point to tell an almost unknown story: fifty years of struggle for equality, for humanity, for love\u2026 the history of the LGBTQ+ struggle. This is a story of three cities. This story will be told through the perspective of three iconic neighborhoods: the Castro in San Francisco, Le Marais in Paris and Greenwich Village in New York. Each of these neighborhoods tell of a specific moment: the repression in the 60s and 70s, the appearance of AIDS in the 80s, the phenomenon of fashion with the appearance of gay marketing and drag-queens in the 90s, the struggle for marriage equality and normalization from the 2000s. This is a story of trans, women and men. Told with a cinematic narrative, with few comments, this film is made up of interviews of direct witnesses of that time (personalities, artists, politicians, entrepreneurs or ordinary citizens), rare archives and current-day filming in these neighborhoods that have so changed. This is a story of pride."
