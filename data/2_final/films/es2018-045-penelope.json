  "synopsis": {
    "native": "Versi\u00f3n el\u00edptica y crepuscular de La Odisea de Homero. La Pen\u00e9lope de esta historia se llama Carmen, tiene el car\u00e1cter de una generaci\u00f3n dura pero sentida, y espera en Santa Mar\u00eda de Ol\u00f3. El Ulises es Ram\u00f3n, que regresa al pueblo tras treinta a\u00f1os de ausencia. Un \u00faltimo viaje cuyo fin, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de lo vivido, es el regreso a una patria y a un modo de vida que se extinguir\u00e1 con ellos.",
    "english": "Once upon a time, in a little place in the mountains, there was an old dressmaker, Carmen, who would weave and unweave the clothes of an entire village. Nobody has been waiting longer than her. She stills hopes after 98 years, even though she might have forgotten what for. One day, Ramon returns to that very same place, his birthplace, to reunite with his people after decades of absence. But no one recognizes him when he returns. Not even her. He has become a stranger. Through a revisitation of the Odyssey's myth, 'Pen\u00e9lope' taps into the universal meaning of the act of waiting. Penelope is the mother, the earth, the starting point. Through her, possibly the last Penelope in our times, we will remember who we were to understand better who we are."
