La mission qu\u2019elles se sont donn\u00e9e est simple \u00ab sauver maman \u00bb et le cadre des op\u00e9rations bien d\u00e9fini : un club de vacances sur l'\u00eele de la R\u00e9union.",
    "english": "Rose is a train-wreck : musician, wild, single, and no stranger to dancing all night (and day) at the club. Her sister Alice couldn\u2019t be more different : a helicopter parent with her life on rails who prides herself in having control over every single aspect of her life. They don't agree on much, except on one thing : they urgently need to cheer up their mother, Fran\u00e7oise, who has just been left by their father for a much younger woman. To celebrate her 60th birthday, Rose and Alice decide to take their mother to a resort on the tropical island of Reunion so they can relax, work on their tans, and have too many margaritas. But when Rose pays a one-night stand, Thierry, to show her mother a good time, their holiday plans start to unravel. What was supposed to be a small confidence-booster turns into something more, as Rose desperately tries to stop things from spiralling out of control..."
