  "synopsis": {
    "native": "\u201cYoutopia\u201d racconta due mondi: uno reale e uno virtuale; il mondo reale \u00e8 cinico, annichilito, spietato, senza aneliti e senza smalto, proprio come lo viviamo, ce lo raccontano e ce lo raccontiamo. Nel mondo virtuale invece succedono cose fantastiche e si possono vivere esperienze che restituiscono alla vita la bellezza magica che altrove sembra perduta.",
    "english": "18-year-old Matilde lives a bleak life with her senile grandmother and her mother, Laura, who is crushed by debts and struggling with no success to find a way to make a better life for her and her family. Matilde does not know about her mother's debts, but copes with her life thanks to her online avatar from utopian universe Landing, a multiplayer online role-playing game where \"she\" hangs out with special friend, Hiro. She has also found an easy way to make money independently: online videochat stripping shows. Ernesto, instead, is a wealthy bourgeois; a pharmacy owner who runs away away from his work and to his wife, with role-playing hookers with whom his money and obsession with sex and possession, create a parallel world of seduction, submission and vice. One day, Laura is forced to reveal her debts to Matilde, who has a plan for a solution, that will unexpectedly involve Ernesto...A contemporary tale that mix neorealism with machinima, drama with fantasy, despair with hope."
