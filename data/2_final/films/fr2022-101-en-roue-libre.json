    "native": "La folle histoire de Louise qui se retrouve, un beau matin, prise au pi\u00e8ge dans sa propre voiture, terrass\u00e9e par une attaque de panique d\u00e8s qu\u2019elle veut en sortir, et de Paul qui vole la voiture et du coup la kidnappe. Les voil\u00e0 tous les deux embarqu\u00e9s dans un road-movie mouvement\u00e9 !",
    "english": "One morning, Louise, 45, is suddenly unable to step out of her car. Sweats, anxieties, palpitations... she is having an inexplicable panic attack. She is tetanized and simply cannot set foot outside. It will surely pass... except it doesn\u2019t ! Freaked out, Louise starts hysterically driving around with no goal. For now, her only option is to keep driving until she runs out of gas... Once at the service station, she\u2019ll eventually have to get out of her car... except she still can\u2019t! That\u2019s when Paul, 20, breaks into her car with one obsession : drive to the ocean. And if she doesn\u2019t like it, she can just get the hell out\u2026 except she really can\u2019t! And so Louise and Paul begin their Tour de France. He thinks she\u2019s crazy, she thinks he\u2019s a jerk. Stuck together, our exceptional duo embarks on a hilarious road trip\u2026 bursting with kinetic energy!"
