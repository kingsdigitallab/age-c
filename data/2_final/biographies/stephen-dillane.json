  "synopsis":[
    "Seemingly content but introspective at the same time in his solitude, a man is dining alone at an isolated and otherwise empty marinaside caf\u00e9 on the French coast when he sees five bald men in a rebuilt orange and blue Citro\u00ebn Dyane dump what appears to be a dead body wrapped and tied up in a plastic sheath into the water. As they approach him with the possible intent of doing him harm for what he saw them do, he is able to abscond without they seeing where he went. In his subsequent getaway, the man drives off in his blue Fiat 500 with two of his seeming most cherished possession, his fedora hat and a framed black and white photograph of a woman. As he tries to evade the men in the Citro\u00ebn who are closely following him at every turn as they both travel through the French countryside, he is a secret interloper in the unusual lives of some of the people he encounters, whereas he is more involved in the equally unusual lives of a number of other people he encounters over and over, such as a bearded man he first meets down by the river, a woman on a bicycle, and a male\/female pair of road surveyors, all the while still being able to indulge in the culinary delights of France. As their collective journeys continue, the question becomes if all is as it appears on the surface, especially concerning the pursuit by the five bald men in the Citro\u00ebn of the man in the Fiat.",
    "Inspired by writer, director, and star Aml Ameen's life, 'Boxing Day' follows Melvin (Ameen), a British author living in America, who returns home to London for Christmas to introduce his American fianc\u00e9e Lisa (King) to his eccentric British-Caribbean family. Their relationship is put to the test as she discovers the world her fianc\u00e9 has left behind.",
    "In May 1940, the fate of World War II hangs on Winston Churchill, who must decide whether to negotiate with Adolf Hitler, or fight on knowing that it could mean the end of the British Empire."
