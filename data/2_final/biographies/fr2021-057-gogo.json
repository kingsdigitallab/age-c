    "english":"Priscilla Sitieni, aka Gogo, lives in heart of the Rift Valley, North West Kenya. She is 94 years old and the oldest primary school pupil. This academic year in the village of Ndalat will be unlike any other. Now in her final year at primary school, Gogo wants to achieve the goal of a lifetime: to pass her exams and obtain her diploma. Encouraged by Myriam, Tracy, her 54 great-grandchildren and the entire school, will this doyenne of pupils become the doyenne of graduates? In a world in which girls\u2019 schooling is still one of the great challenges of this millennium, we follow the unique journey of this very special woman from Kenya, ready for anything to fulfil her dream before she dies. A thrilling true story, full of poetry, humour and love."
