  "synopsis":[
    "Shot mainly in South East London, it's about Micky Mason, a skilled manual worker who, since the Crash, can find nothing but menial zero hours jobs. He takes a course of action that is completely out of character, but it's the only way he can see of keeping his family together. It is about surviving, but it's not all anguish and despair - it's also warm and tender, and funny. It's about people finding their way through. It's about Micky Mason; a man out there, right now, doing his best.",
    "The story of a geriatric ward in a small Yorkshire hospital threatened with closure."
