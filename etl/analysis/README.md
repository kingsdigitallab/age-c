# Analysis

This directory contains TypeScript scripts used to analyse the processed data.
The scripts are independent from the ETL process and can be run individually.

## Getting started

The `frontend` uses `bun` to run the frontend application, which is also the
recommended way to run the scripts.

1. Install `bun` as described in the [README](../../frontend/README.md).
1. Run the following command to run a script:

   ```bash
   bun run scriptName.ts
   ```
