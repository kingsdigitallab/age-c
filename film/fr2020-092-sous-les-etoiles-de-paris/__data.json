Par une nuit comme il n’en existe que dans les contes, un jeune garçon de 8 ans fait irruption devant son abri. Suli ne parle pas français, il est perdu, séparé de sa mère… Ensemble, ils partent à sa recherche. À travers les rues de Paris, Christine et Suli vont apprendre à se connaître et à s’apprivoiser. Et Christine à retrouver une humanité qu’elle croyait disparue.","Christine's life has not been easy lately. Her lonely routine is divided between free food banks distributions and wandering the streets of Paris. On a cold winter night, she finds Suli, an 8-year-old Burkinabe boy, sobbing in front of her shelter. Christine understands that he is lost and has been separated from his mother. Bounded by their marginal condition, they embark together on an emotional journey full of tenderness to find Suli’s mother in the underground world of Paris."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
