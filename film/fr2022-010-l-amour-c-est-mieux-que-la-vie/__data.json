Pour en parler le plus simplement possible, Gérard, Ary et Philippe ont fait connaissance il y a 20 ans, à leur sortie de prison, et se sont tout de suite posé la vraie question : Et si l’honnêteté était la meilleure des combines ? Aujourd’hui, ils sont inséparables et scrupuleusement vertueux… Mais Gérard apprend qu’il souffre d’un mal incurable. Le sachant condamné, Ary et Philippe veulent lui offrir sa dernière histoire d’amour… car Gérard a toujours répété que l'amour c’était mieux que la vie.","Love. Friendship. Money. Humankind’s three main concerns. In a nutshell : Upon their release from prison 20 years earlier, Gérard, Ary and Philippe ask themselves the big question : what if honesty is the best racket of them all ? Today, they are inseparable and scrupulously above board… And then Gérard learns he is terminally ill. Their friend’s days being numbered, Ary and Philippe want to offer him one last love story… because, as Gérard likes to say : love is better than life."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
