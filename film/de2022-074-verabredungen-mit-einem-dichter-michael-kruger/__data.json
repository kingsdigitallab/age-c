Michael Krüger has not only shaped the landscape of publishing in Germany over the past 50 years, he has also created a diverse and inspiring body of work as a writer. In the film we follow him from his final year at Hanser Verlag to him stepping down from his role as President of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts. In the process, Michael Krüger appears astute and full of life even at the age of 75."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
