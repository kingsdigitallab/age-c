Khalil se busca la vida como puede y pasa los días junto a un viejo furtivo, que comparte una casa en la orilla del río con un hermano con el que no se habla desde hace años. En las orillas de la marisma, las mareas marcan el tiempo del amor y el desamor, de la amistad y la venganza.","Khalil is an uprooted young man who lives small tricks in a border area where industrial buildings and swamps rub shoulders. He regularly visits Jose Ramon, an old man with a troubled past who lives in a house by the river. This house he shares it with his brother Martin, whom he has not spoken to for years. In the swamp, more or less lost souls rub shoulders, without necessarily crossing each other."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
