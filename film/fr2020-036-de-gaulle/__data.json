Charles de Gaulle, newly appointed General, joins the Government in Paris while Yvonne, his wife, and their three children stay in the East. Facing the defeatist attitude of Pétain ready to negotiate with Hitler, de Gaulle has one purpose: continue fighting. Alongside thousands of French families, Yvonne and the children are soon forced to flee the advancing German troops. Without contact from one another, the doubt arises: will the de Gaulle family be sacrificed for the sake of France? An outstanding destiny that will change the course of World War II and French History."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
