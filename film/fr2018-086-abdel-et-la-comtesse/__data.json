Elle ne peut cependant se résoudre à transmettre le domaine à Gonzague, un neveu arrogant et cupide, plutôt qu’à sa fille. Quand Abdel, un jeune de cité débrouillard et astucieux, trouve refuge dans leur château, sa rencontre avec la comtesse va faire des étincelles ! Issus de deux mondes que tout oppose, ils pourraient bien s’aider mutuellement...","Abdel, a young French Arab from the hood, has an unusual talent for spotting rare antiques. His last heist brings him to a youth detention centre, sponsored by the Countess of Montberier, whose husband recently passed away. The next male heir is a nephew the Countess cannot stand. On one of the Countess' visits to the youth detention centre, Abdel escapes in the trunk of her car. After numerous trials and tribulations, an unlikely friendship ensues between the aristocrat and the young man; and they are both able to help each other out of their respective jams."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
