Dans un entretien enregistré à son domicile, face à la caméra 16mm, le psychiatre n’écoute plus : il parle, il pense. Il n’accompagne plus le patient, mais le spectateur, dans sa réflexion débordante. En racontant sa vie, ses passions, ses luttes et ses déceptions, il perpétue son combat humaniste pour ceux qui n’ont plus la force ou le verbe de le faire.","At the dawn of retirement, in the heart of a night in January, Georges Federmann confides. In an interview recorded at his home, facing the 16mm camera, the psychiatrist does not listen any more: he speaks, he thinks. It no longer accompanies the patient, but the viewer, in his overflowing reflection. By recounting his life, his passions, his struggles and his disappointments, he perpetuates his humanist struggle for those who no longer have the strength or the verb to do so."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
