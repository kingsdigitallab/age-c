Shortly after the chance encounter, he shows up at the family home as a handyman to renovate the bathroom. Roland welcomes him with open arms, but Marta is skeptical because Valmir is behaving strangely towards her. She soon suspects that his appearance could reveal a dark secret from her past that neither Roland nor Nathan know anything about. And indeed: Valmir seems to know that Marta was working as an obstetrician in Albania at the time of Nathan's birth. He soon claims that Marta illegally took Nathan into her care after his birth in Albania after his biological mother died during childbirth. But how can he know that? Is Valmir Nathan's father? Marta becomes terrified of losing Nathan and tries everything she can to prevent a discussion. She hopes to satisfy Valmir with a large sum of money.
