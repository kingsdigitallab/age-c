Like the statue emerging from the granite, his memories, too, emerge, fragmented, inlaid between History and the personal experiences of Shelomo, who was a first-hand witness to the events. His son Rami, who is a plastic surgeon, and Pierre Abramovici, a historian and family friend, guide us on this journey made of history and art, between the need to remember and the need to forget."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
