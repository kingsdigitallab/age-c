Iolanda ha vissuto per 36 anni nella famiglia della regista, prima di fuggire in Canada. Era una persona di famiglia ma con un ruolo subalterno, un‚Äôidentit√† liminare, che oscillava tra l'amore e l'odio, tra ribellione e accettazione. In un viaggio a ritroso nel tempo la regista ricostruisce insieme alla sua vecchia tata il lungo percorso fisico e ideale che le ha separate per pi√π di 30 anni. Tra aneliti di libert√† e legami inscindibili riprende vita una ‚Äúmicro-storia‚Äù che racconta il nostro paese, le sue molteplici culture e il tentativo di superarle per rivendicare la propria autodeterminazione.",english:"Still a child, Iolanda was entrusted as a maid to a wealthy family in Vibo Valentia (South Italy): that family was the mine.
