Dès leur arrivée, ils entament un véritable parcours du combattant pour obtenir l’asile politique, avec la menace d’être expulsés à tout moment. Grâce à son don pour les échecs, Fahim rencontre Sylvain, l’un des meilleurs entraîneurs d’échecs de France. Entre méfiance et attirance, ils vont apprendre à se connaître et se lier d’amitié. Alors que le Championnat de France commence, la menace d’expulsion se fait pressante et Fahim n’a plus qu’une seule chance pour s’en sortir : être Champion de France.","Forced to flee his native Bangladesh, eight year-old chess prodigy Fahim arrives in Paris with his father. Refused asylum, as illegal immigrants they spiral downwards into homelessness and desperation. By a stroke of luck, Fahim is introduced to one of France’s top chess coaches, Sylvain (real name: Xavier Parmentier), who tutors him and gives him a sense of purpose - his struggles on the chessboard mirroring both his victories and his crushing defeats in his battle for a normal life. Fahim then rises through local and national tournaments only to be crowned France’s Under-12 Chess Champion in 2012. The film tells the story of a child who learns to live without his mother and without his father, far from home, from his roots and his language. Fahim’s tale is not only a moving account of the grim realities that underlie a supposedly caring society, but also a heartwarming testimony to a father’s determination, the kindness of strangers, and one small boy’s courageous will to succeed."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
