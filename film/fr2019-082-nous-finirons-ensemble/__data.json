Sa bande de potes, qu’il n’a pas vue depuis plus de 3 ans débarque par surprise pour lui fêter son anniversaire ! La surprise est entière mais l’accueil l’est beaucoup moins... Max s’enfonce alors dans une comédie du bonheur qui sonne faux, et qui mettra le groupe dans des situations pour le moins inattendues. Les enfants ont grandi, d’autres sont nés, les parents n’ont plus les mêmes priorités... Les séparations, les accidents de la vie... Quand tous décident de ne plus mettre de petits mouchoirs sur les gros bobards, que reste-t-il de l’amitié ?","With lots on his mind, Max takes off for a long weekend alone in his beach house. Three years after they all fell out, his buddies rock up to spring a surprise birthday party on him there. The surprise is total and Max's welcome nothing less than reserved. He insists on presenting a happy front that rings hollow and lands the whole group in unexpected situations. Children have grown, babies have been born, priorities have changed. Separations and the ups-and-downs of life... When everybody decides to stop telling their little white lies, what remains of friendship?"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
