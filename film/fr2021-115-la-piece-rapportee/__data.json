Leur mariage n’est pas du goût de « maman », Adélaïde Château-Têtard, qu’on appelle aussi la Reine Mère. Pourtant cette dernière s’en accommode : un héritier serait le bienvenu. Mais le bébé tarde à venir... Une guerre sans pitié s’engage entre les deux femmes, la Reine-mère étant persuadée qu’Ava trompe son fils. Il doit bien y avoir un amant quelque part…","Paul Château-Têtard, a 45-year-old bachelor from the best of Parisian nobility, has – for the first time in his life – to take the Metro, and even buy a ticket. It is with extraordinary luck that the beautiful young Ava happens to be sitting at the counter: a spark ignites and wedding bells begin ringing in the distance. However, Paul’s mother, “Queen” Adélaïde, thinks little of the marriage and even less of Ava: An heir would be most welcome, but a baby is nowhere to be seen – and where does this lowly young lady spend the whole day anyway? Adélaïde sets shady detectives to sniff out affairs. The “nobility” collides with the “rabble”."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
