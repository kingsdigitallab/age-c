Jusqu’en 1982, Charles filmera des heures de pellicules qui formeront le corpus de son journal filmé. Aznavour filme sa vie et vit comme il filme. Partout où il va, sa caméra est là, avec lui. Elle enregistre tout. Les moments de vie, les lieux qu’il traverse, ses amis, ses amours, ses emmerdes. Quelque mois avant sa disparition il entame avec Marc di Domenico le dérushage de ses films. Il décide alors d’en faire un film, son film.","In 1948, Édith Piaf offers his first camera to Charles Aznavour, a Paillard that he'll keep forever. Until 1982, Charles filmed hours of reel, as he would have kept a diary. Aznavour films his life and lives as he films. Wherever he goes, his camera is there with him, recording everything, the key moments of his life, his travels, his friends, his loves, his boredom. A few months before he passed, he began, together with Marc di Domenico, the derushing of these films and decided to make a film, his film."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
