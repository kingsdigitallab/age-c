Le spectacle sera sur scène et dans l’assiette, avec les bons produits du coin. Il en est sûr, ça ne peut que marcher ! Ses proches, sa mère et surtout son grand-père, sont plus sceptiques.","Hard work and big ideas aren't enough. David's dairy farm is on the brink of liquidation. When he chances upon a dazzling nightclub performance by Bonnie Starlight, inspiration strikes. What if he turned his big old barn into a country cabaret? Not just for entertainment, but to promote local food producers, including his mother's delicious cheese. A crazy plan, for sure - which is exactly why he loves it! David has to convince sophisticated “City Girl” Bonnie to live in a converted barn loft out in the middle of nowhere and work around the clock to make a great show out of nothing. Finding local talent is no small feat either, but together they manage to assemble a zany cast of characters and create a troupe. Through blood sweat and tears, and a whole lot of laughs, they not only build a great stage and get their act together, they also learn a thing or two about themselves and each other. Everything seems on track for the big opening night, until David's traditionalist grandpa steps in, hell-bent on putting an end to their follies. Can they save the show and save the farm?"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
