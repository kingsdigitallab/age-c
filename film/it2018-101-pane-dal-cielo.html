They squat close to Bicocca, near Greco-Pirelli station. Annibale is about fifty. Lilly is forty, more or less. On Christmas eve, Lilli and Annibale find a baby in a dumpster. He is a little boy. He’s healthy and kicking. The two homeless try to take the baby to the closest children’s hospital but they witness an extraordinary event. None of the doctors or nurses see the child. The scene is surreal: Lilli and Annibale raise the child before the doctors’ eyes and all they see is thin air. Nothing at all. No baby. It is not like that for everybody. There is somebody else apart from Annibale and Lilli who can see the child. It seems that the child is invisible to most people living in homes. The two homeless find themselves turned into improvised parents of a very special child. At the station deposit where they decide to take care of the child, a small community starts to assemble: a mixed family of homeless of every kind and nature. What is it that generates this difference between people? Why is it that only some can see the child? It is necessary to put the pieces of a very complex puzzle together before one can understand the difference between those who can and cannot see the child. It is evident however that the child is a the messanger of a truth that has to be spread. A young blogger and a lady worried by her son’s behaviour help the community reach the people living in homes. The news of the child spreads quickly and attracts more and more people. This is how the arrival of the child becomes the driving force of change. The child’s message reaches into the hearts of the unexpected. Also the hearts of those in charge of the financial system and who are responsible for many of the injustices of our times. This is a new opportunity for everybody. For Annibale and Lilli and for all the people. And then, just as the child had arrived, it vanishes. Certain that the message it bears will have serious repercussions.</blockquote><!--]--> <!--[--><h2>Synopsis</h2> <blockquote>Lilli and Annibale live in Milan.
