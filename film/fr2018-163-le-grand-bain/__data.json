Ensemble, ils se sentent libres et utiles. Ils vont mettre toute leur énergie dans une discipline jusque-là propriété de la gent féminine : la natation synchronisée. Alors, oui c’est une idée plutôt bizarre, mais ce défi leur permettra de trouver un sens à leur vie...","A group of 40-something guys, all on the verge of a mid-life crisis, decide to form their local pool’s first ever synchronized swimming team – for men. Braving the skepticism and ridicule of those around them, and trained by a fallen champion trying to pull herself together, the group set out on an unlikely adventure, and on the way will rediscover a little self-esteem and a lot about themselves and each other."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
