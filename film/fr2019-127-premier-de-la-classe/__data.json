Quand arrive la première réunion parents-profs, il va monter le plus gros mytho de sa vie : recruter des faux profs parmi ses connaissances du quartier pour faire face à son vrai père, pendant que ses vrais profs rencontreront son faux père. Ca devrait être facile... en théorie !","Abou, 13, is his father’s pride and joy. Unlike his 3 brothers, he’s « top of his class ». Well, that’s what he pretends to be.
