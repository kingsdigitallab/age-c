Contrairement à ses 3 frères, il est « 1er de sa classe ». Enfin, c’est ce qu’il fait croire. En vérité, Abou est surtout le roi du mensonge et du bulletin truqué ! Quand arrive la première réunion parents-profs, il va monter le plus gros mytho de sa vie : recruter des faux profs parmi ses connaissances du quartier pour faire face à son vrai père, pendant que ses vrais profs rencontreront son faux père. Ca devrait être facile... en théorie !","Abou, 13, is his father’s pride and joy. Unlike his 3 brothers, he’s « top of his class ». Well, that’s what he pretends to be. Actually, Abou is more the king of lies and rigged report cards ! When the first parent-teacher conference comes up, he will stage the biggest lie of his life : hire fake teachers to meet his father, while his real teachers will meet his fake father. It should be easy... in theory !"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
