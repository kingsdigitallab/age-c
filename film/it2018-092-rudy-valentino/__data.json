(“Rudy Valentino” tells the story, between reality and fantasy, of Rodolfo Valentino's return to his native village, Castellaneta, in the summer of 1923. The story, however, begins today. In a small theater of Castellaneta, an amateur company is rehearsing a show on Rudy “the star”. It tells about the triumphant return home of Rudy Valentino, the world's greatest sex symbol.

An impostor, a delusional man, or the true Rudy magically resurfacing from the past? While our artistic director bitterly tries to read his script, the theatrical performance magically comes to life.
