Solitaire, il est bouleversé quand il rencontre la femme de sa vie, Philomène (Laetitia Casta). De leur union naît Alice. Pour cette enfant qu’il aime plus que tout, Cheval se jette alors dans un pari fou : lui construire de ses propres mains, un incroyable palais. Jamais épargné par les épreuves de la vie, cet homme ordinaire n’abandonnera pas et consacrera 33 ans à bâtir une œuvre extraordinaire : « Le Palais idéal ».","South of France, 1879. Ferdinand Cheval is a reserved and quiet man. A rural mail carrier, he enjoys the loneliness of his 20 miles rounds, daydreaming about a world full of wonder and beauty he only glances through postcards and magazines. After the birth of Alice, his daughter, he has a revelation: building a castle to make her a princess. With no architectural background, driven by his love for Alice, the unconditional support of Philomene – his wife – and his vision."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
