Doch ganz gleich, wie sehr sich die junge Pflegerin auch anstrengt, der kontrollsüchtigen Almut kann sie nichts recht machen.","After studying German, a young woman from Ukraine has taken a job as a 24-hour caregiver in a family where the adult children have an extremely strained relationship with the demented patriarch out of financial necessity. She promptly gets caught in a veritable minefield of poisoned circumstances, but with sensitivity manages to bring about a gradual change. A tragicomedy that takes up the irritating topic of the German nursing crisis and the working conditions of foreign caregivers with subversive power, whereby the tone changes from depressingly quiet to humorously whimsical and accurate dialogues and gestures impressively explore the social field of tension."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
