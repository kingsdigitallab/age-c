Aujourd'hui, son chauffeur, Manu, le conduit à la pendaison de crémaillère de sa productrice et amie de longue date, Nathalie, qui a emménagé dans une belle maison près de Paris. Hélène, sœur de Nathalie et ex-femme de Castro, est elle aussi invitée. Quand ils étaient jeunes, ils partageaient les mêmes idéaux mais le succès a converti Castro au pragmatisme (ou plutôt au cynisme) tandis qu'Hélène est restée fidèle à ses convictions.

Hélène, Nathalie’s sister and Castro’s ex-wife, is running around as usual, trying to convince guests to sign a petition in support of an Afghan refugee. She barely notices the arrival of their daughter Nina, who just published a book in which the main characters borrow heavily from her parents’ flaws...
