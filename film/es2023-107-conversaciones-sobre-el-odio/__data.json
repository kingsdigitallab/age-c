In this intimate and deep conversation, they discuss their views on maternity, friendship, and their ways of dealing with the disease. Débora (Cecilia Roth) is a manipulative talent agent who gradually unleashes her rage on Déborah, a serious and intellectual actress (Maricel Álvarez). A manifesto against the discrimination of the so-called toxic people; against the idea that people getting sick is their own fault and that they can get better at will; against the selling marketing and the unreal consumption of happiness and well being. A film based on the Bechdel test (a method for measuring the gender gap in movies): two women, a conversation where no one speaks of men."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
