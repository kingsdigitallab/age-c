Súbitamente, Irene le llama, nerviosa, y le pide ayuda porque la gente a su alrededor se comporta de modo diferente, como si hubieran perdido sus recuerdos y emociones. Influenciado por las películas y series que han marcado su vida, Víctor no es capaz de ofrecer una explicación racional a lo que está pasando, pero decide convertirse en el héroe que nunca fue para Irene e ir a “rescatarla”, liándolo aún más cuando sus amigos deciden “ayudarle”.","The end of relationship of Victor with Irene and the start of a new one with Lola have aggravated a Peter Pan syndrome he just can't overcome. His existence is suddenly turned on when inexplicable things start to happen around him. Something is possessing people, causing their behaviour to change. Influenced by the films and series that have marked his childhood in the 80s, Victor is not able to find a rational explanation and facts become even more entangled when his friends decide to help him. And Victor will have to face his fears and become the hero he never was to save Irene before she's possessed by this new syndrome."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
