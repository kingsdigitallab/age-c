Jouant avec les émotions et les sentiments – surtout ceux des autres – brouillant les pistes entre réalité et fiction, elle prend des risques dont elle ne mesure pas toujours les conséquences… Son couple y résistera-t-il ? Finira- t-elle son film ?","A director is filming a documentary on polyamory: somewhere between documentary and fiction, she takes risks and she cannot always measure the consequences. As a combination of documentary and fiction, the film could be classified as a 'UMO': Unidentified Movie Object! On the one hand: a serious, poised, and thought-through documentary with speakers who have reflected on the topic or who live it everyday. On the other hand: a comedy about a female director who plays with fire by testing out polyamory on her own relationship. Between the two, a grey area in which fiction gets entangled with reality. Will her sweetheart be able to stand up to the challenge of polyamory? Will she finish her film?"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
