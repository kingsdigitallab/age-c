L’incontro con un famoso cantante in una estate diversa da tutte le altre le farà conoscere il suo talento nascosto e confermerà la sua passione più grande: la musica.","Anita, a 17-year-old girl shy and insecure, feels different from her peers but still doesn't know who she is. In a summer by the sea, instead of spending the days with other kids and experiencing the holidays' lightheartedness, she prefers to study the piano to prepare for an exam at the Conservatory. But next to her lives Vins, a legendary rock star with a turbulent past. Vins recognizes her special talent and will spur Anita into discovering another way of experiencing music and a voice she doesn't even know she has. Even her meeting with Vittore, a shy boy different from all the others, will make her discover herself in that summer that she will always remember, her Soul Summer."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
