(Anita, a 17-year-old girl shy and insecure, feels different from her peers but still doesn't know who she is. In a summer by the sea, instead of spending the days with other kids and experiencing the holidays' lightheartedness, she prefers to study the piano to prepare for an exam at the Conservatory.
