Le roman devient un best-seller. Mais son auteur, Henri Pick, un pizzaïolo breton décédé deux ans plus tôt, n’aurait selon sa veuve jamais écrit autre chose que ses listes de courses. Persuadé qu’il s’agit d’une imposture, un célèbre critique littéraire décide de mener l’enquête, avec l’aide inattendue de la fille de l’énigmatique Henri Pick.","In a bizarre Breton library that collects rejected, never published manuscripts, a young editor discovers a novel that she considers a masterpiece. It was written by a certain Henri Pick, a cook who died two years earlier and who, according to his widow, had never read a book in his life or written anything but a shopping list... Did he have a secret life? When the book becomes a huge best-seller, Jean- Michel Rouche, a skeptical and stubborn literary critic, teams up with Joséphine, Pick’s daughter, to unravel the mystery. What if this story was only a conspiracy...?"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
