Elle est cependant troublée par la présence de Pierre, cet homme de 45 ans qu’elle avait brièvement croisé, des années plus tôt. Et contre toute attente, Pierre ne voit pas en elle « une femme d’un certain âge », mais une femme, désirable, qu’il n’a pas peur d’aimer. À ceci près que Pierre est marié et père de famille.","Elegant, retired architect Shauna (70) crosses paths with Pierre, a happily married doctor in his 40s, who first made an impression on her in a brief meeting 15 years ago. Both are quite troubled to meet again and begin an affair. While Pierre’s family life is soon turned upside down, Shauna struggles with feelings she thought belonged to the past."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
