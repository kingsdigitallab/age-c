Amancio is a middle-aged man with the mind of a small child. The only contact he has with other people is with Iria, a young government social worker who he is innocently in love with, and Pedro, an old, philosophical fisherman who seems to be the only human who lives in the area. On a nearby beach Amancio finds assorted objects rejected by the sea, and he hides them in a cave that only he knows. One morning, on one of his walks on the beach, Amancio finds a strange capsule that seems to have something mysterious inside. Before long he'll discover that there are dangerous people asking around the area, looking for that object, and that his life and the lives of the people he knows are in serious danger because of it."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
