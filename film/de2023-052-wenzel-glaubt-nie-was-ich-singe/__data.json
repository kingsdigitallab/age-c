Schon zu DDR-Zeiten machte er Liedertheater und Kabarett. Heute führt ihn sein Schaffen bis nach Nashville. Doch die Corona-Pandemie hat dem Künstler mehr Zwangspausen eingebracht, als ihm lieb waren. Lew Hohmann hat ihn für diesen Dokumentarfilm mit der Kamera begleitet.","Hans-Eckardt Wenzel is an authentic poet and thoroughbred musician, advanced in the GDR to a cult figure, produced about fifty albums. With his clownish to Dadaist concerts, the poet and songwriter thrilled his fans and largely escaped the Stasi due to the special nature of his lyrics. Lew Hohmann accompanies the artist over a longer period of time and adds archive sequences with real surprises."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
