The women we meet on our journey devote their life's to rock music, each of them is an icebreaker and they are as inspiring as different. 'You have to be like a man. But I can do it, I am a woman with balls', is Linda Gail Lewis' Credo, while Kathy Valentine of The Go-Go's considers herself a 'rare bird'. Suzi Quatro proclaims that she doesn't do gender at all, while Rosie Flores emphasizes her female qualities when playing the guitar.
