Nun sitzt er alleine da, seine Frau hat ihn verlassen, sein Sohn will nichts mit ihm zu tun haben, er ist von seiner Arbeit angeödet und zu allem Überfluss verkündet seine Ärztin ihm auch noch, dass er nicht mehr lange zu leben haben wird. Doch statt den Kopf in den Sand zu stecken, beschließt Rainer, die alte Band wieder zusammenzutrommeln: „Bochums Steine“ sollen ein sensationelles Comeback feiern und endlich den Durchbruch bekommen, den sie verdienen. Doch kann Rainer seine ehemaligen Bandkollegen Bulle (Armin Rohde), Konni (Matthias Bundschuh), Thomas (Richy Müller) und Ole (Jürgen Vogel) überzeugen?","Every day counts. What sounds like a hackneyed calendar phrase involuntarily becomes the motto of life for the music teacher Rainer. A brain tumor eats its way through the head of the mid-fifties and at best gives him another year. The inventory of his existence so far is not very intoxicating: with his ex-wife Brigitte there is no turning back, for his son Daniel he is anything but a good dad and only his worn-out guitar reminds of the childhood dream of a rock career. That his band \"Bochums Steine\" didn't make it 30 years ago was mainly due to Rainer and his ego. Now he would like to round up the boys again - for a farewell or a belated breakthrough? Who knows. At the concert organizer Steffi he runs into open doors with his revival idea. The drummer Bulle, bassist Konni and keyboardist Thomas - all between a middle-class existence and an age-related life crisis - join in after initial hesitation. To get the singer Ole back on board, however, Rainer has to jump over his shadow - and straighten what he screwed up at the time. He doesn't have much time."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
