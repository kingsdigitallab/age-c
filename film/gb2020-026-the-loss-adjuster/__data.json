An insurance Loss Adjuster for many years, he spends his time assessing other people's problems and ignoring his own. His wife Angie aspires to greater things and when finances hit rock bottom, she leaves him for a suave loan shark one week before Christmas. Martin is crest fallen but forced into continuing his day by the overly exuberant company secretary, who has scheduled several claims for Martin to validate. With a heavy heart, Martin sets off but his day drastically goes from bad to worse with a catalogue of extraordinary and humorous encounters with a flirtatious and rather amorous widow, a corrupt Doctor, a lascivious female escort and a dead rat. It is only at the funeral of a client that Martin has an epiphany; and with the help of his unlikely friendship with a teenage thief and perhaps a sprinkling of Christmas magic, life suddenly changes in a truly remarkable way.",[4,5,6,7,8],"wealth","independent home","urban","retirement","festivities",{"id":10,"type":11,"slug":12,"title":13,"filmType":14,"release":15,"production":19,"media":23,"genre":26,"tags":3,"director":29,"character":34,"synopsis":59},"GB2020_026","Film","gb2020-026-the-loss-adjuster",{"native":1},"Fiction film",{"type":16,"date":17,"year":18},"Theatrical release","2020-11-27",2020,[20],{"country":21,"share":22},"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)","Majority coproducer",{"trailerUrl":24,"posterUrl":25},"https://www.filmaffinity.com/es/evideos.php?movie_id=487303","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6841828/mediaviewer/rm1865657601/?ref_=tt_ov_i",[27,28],"Comedy","Romance",[30],{"id":31,"slug":32,"name":31,"gender":33,"nationality":21},"Vincent Woods","vincent-woods","Male identifying",[35,50],{"id":36,"age":37,"gender":33,"sexuality":38,"origin":39,"class":40,"profession":41,"ability":42,"assistedMobility":43,"person":44,"role":49},"GB2020_026_01","3: Third Age (60-75)","Unknown","White Western European","Middle class","Retired","Able-bodied","No",{"id":45,"slug":46,"name":45,"birthYear":47,"gender":33,"nationality":48},"Guy Siner","guy-siner",1947,"United States of America (the)","Supporting actor",{"id":51,"age":52,"gender":53,"sexuality":38,"origin":39,"class":54,"profession":41,"ability":42,"assistedMobility":43,"person":55,"role":49},"GB2020_026_02","4: Fourth Age (>75)","Female identifying","Upper Middle class",{"id":56,"slug":57,"name":56,"birthYear":58,"gender":53,"nationality":21},"Joan Collins","joan-collins",1933,{"native":2}],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
