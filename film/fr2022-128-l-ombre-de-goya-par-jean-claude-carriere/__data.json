Pour en percer le mystère, il accomplit un dernier voyage en Espagne qui le ramène sur les traces du peintre. Des liens se tissent avec des artistes issus du monde du cinéma, de la littérature et de la musique montrant à quel point l'œuvre de Goya est influente. Au-delà de sa portée immense, c'est un dialogue entre les vivants et les morts qui s'engage.","In his last journey, screenwriter Jean Claude Carriere returns to Spain and talks to us about the painter, Francisco de Goya, that he always admired (and to whom he dedicated a film, The Ghosts of Goya with Milos Forman). Very quickly, personal memories begin to emerge. Buñuel and Surrealism obviously, but also how Goya anticipated modernity, not only in the pictorial sense but also on the topics covered that preoccupied him: war, migration, disability (Goya was deaf), the ‘’little people’’ and above all, the stigmata of a mad world. Goya, as Malraux said, was the last of the Classics and the first of the Moderns. Travelling to Goya’s key places, diving into his abundant work, the filmmaker José Luis López- Linares (Bosch: The Garden of Dreams) and Jean-Claude Carrière, one of the most prolific scriptwriters of all times (Belle de Jour, That Obscure Object of Desire, Valmont, At Eternity’s Gate) invite us on a journey into human genius."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
