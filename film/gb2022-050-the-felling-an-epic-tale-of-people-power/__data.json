What started as innocent local protest, turned into a nightmare, attracting national and international support. As the stakes increased with threats of bankruptcy and imprisonment, ordinary citizens were forced to ask themselves the crucial question: How far am I prepared to go to save a tree? Filmed over 2 years, this is an extraordinary and shocking first-hand account of what happened on the tree-lined suburban streets of Sheffield."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
