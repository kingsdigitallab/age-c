La Penélope de esta historia se llama Carmen, tiene el carácter de una generación dura pero sentida, y espera en Santa María de Oló. El Ulises es Ramón, que regresa al pueblo tras treinta años de ausencia. Un último viaje cuyo fin, más allá de lo vivido, es el regreso a una patria y a un modo de vida que se extinguirá con ellos.","Once upon a time, in a little place in the mountains, there was an old dressmaker, Carmen, who would weave and unweave the clothes of an entire village. Nobody has been waiting longer than her. She stills hopes after 98 years, even though she might have forgotten what for. One day, Ramon returns to that very same place, his birthplace, to reunite with his people after decades of absence. But no one recognizes him when he returns. Not even her. He has become a stranger. Through a revisitation of the Odyssey's myth, 'Penélope' taps into the universal meaning of the act of waiting. Penelope is the mother, the earth, the starting point. Through her, possibly the last Penelope in our times, we will remember who we were to understand better who we are."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
