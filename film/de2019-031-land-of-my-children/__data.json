Doch ist er so weit?","Darío Aguirre moved from Ecuador to Germany to be with Stephanie, but from the very first day there was a third party in their relationship:the government. They issued him ten visas in fifteen years. A long trail of papers, stamps, permits, and restrictions connected Darío to Germany while also keeping him at a distance.

Darío responds with a tender, ironic road movie that traces his intertwined journey from the country of his fathers to the country of his children."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
