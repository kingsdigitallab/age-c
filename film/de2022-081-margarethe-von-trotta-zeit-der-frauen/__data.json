Ihr Leben, ihre Liebe zum Film und den immerwährenden Kampf des Filmemachens als Frau – hinter der Kamera. Die deutsche Regie-Ikone inspiriert mit ihren Filmen und ihrer zarten und selbstbewussten, warmen Art.","An artist of Margarethe von Trotta’s calibre is rare in Germany. Margarethe von Trotta was back in the 1960s one of the very few women working as a film director and has layed the foundation for many young female artists. In February 2022 she will turn 80, offering the perfect opportunity to make a full-length documentary film about her. Her filmography is one of the most important in international film history and she is currently working on adding to her already impressive portfolio with a new, major feature film. The exciting thing about this project is that it explores important periods in German history via her films. The 1960s, the RAF era, the women’s movement and the Fall of the Wall – Margarethe von Trotta’s films have dealt with all of these topics. And at the same time, von Trotta is a subtle investigator of the architecture of the human soul – the female soul, in particular."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
