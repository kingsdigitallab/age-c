Célibataire désabusé, il est lui-même hanté par le désir d’être père et compte bien traiter ce problème scientifiquement. Le hic c’est qu’à Bellerose il y a seulement 3 femmes en âge de procréer, soit une chance sur 6232,33 de rencontrer la mère de ses futurs enfants. Pourtant un jour, en sauvant de la noyade un étrange poisson à pattes, Daniel va réapprendre à tomber amoureux.","The sea has become infested with jellyfish since fish can no longer reproduce. Daniel, a biologist charged with unravelling this mystery, is obsessed with becoming a father. Statistically he has only 1 chance in 6,233.33 of meeting a woman likely to share his dream. Lucie, a young woman with a sharp sense of humor, relieves her constant melancholy with a passion for the subtle language of piranhas. When Daniel fixes a date with Lucie through a dating app, he comes across a strange fish caught in a net – a fish named Nietzsche – and circumstances finally become favorable for him to find what he has been truly lacking: love."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
