There he lives austerely, in a ramshackle house without electric light or unnecessary luxuries, and plays the banjo in a friends' club. Until one day, after many years, he receives the unexpected visit of his daughter Anna and his grandson Marc. Anna, unemployed for some time, says she has had to accept a job in France and is forced to leave her little son on the island with grandfather Samuel."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
