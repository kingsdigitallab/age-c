În România măsurile disperate luate de regimul comunist i-au afectat pe mai mulți locuitori din nord; din cauza radiațiilor femeile sunt forțate să avorteze prin metode improvizate (sub o presiune indirectă de la partid). Irina, învățătoare în satul în care locuiește, mamă a doi copii, soție de căpitan de vas, se află sub presiunea familiei și trebuie să ia o decizie cumplită. Va alege să renunțe sau își va asuma cu orice consecință viața? Câțiva ani mai târziu, regimul comunist din România se prăbușește, sentimentul libertății nu este clar, iar decizia Irinei este aspru criticată de copii. Ce este libertatea? devine întrebarea pe care toți o avem și pentru al cărui răspuns luptăm și în prezent. Libertatea rămâne singura opțiune!",english:"The year 1986 is the time when several women from northern Bukovina, from Iasi, Vrancea and Tulcea, were forced to have abortions in inhumane conditions, although abortion was forbidden.
