En marge du monde civilisé, leur tribu recycle en toute illégalité notre rebut pour s’aménager de manière farfelue un hameau de bric et de broc. La vie pourrait ainsi couler si une équipe policière ne se mettait sur leurs traces…","english":"A small clan lives in the underworld of a rubbish dump. They recycle the waste they find or steal, in order to cobble their home together. Life there could be so sweet, were it not for a chief inspector hot on their heels."}}
