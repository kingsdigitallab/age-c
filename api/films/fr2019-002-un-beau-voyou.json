Est-ce l’élégance du procédé ? L’audace du délit ? La beauté de l’œuvre volée ? Beffrois enquêtera comme on mange une dernière sucrerie, découvrant peu à peu un voleur atypique, véritable courant d’air, acrobate à ses heures.","english":"Captain Beffrois is about to retire from the police. He has mixed feelings about retirement. The theft of a painting captures his attention. Is it because of the elegance and daring of the crime or the beauty of the stolen object? Beffrois goes after a very unusual thief, quite the acrobat who slips in and out, unnoticed."}}
