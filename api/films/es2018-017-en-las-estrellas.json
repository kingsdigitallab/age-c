Es alcohólico, está en paro y terriblemente deprimido, en gran parte a causa de la muerte de su mujer. Sin embargo, Víctor sigue siendo el mejor en una cosa: contarle historias fantásticas a su hijo de nueve años, Ingmar. Dichas historias son cada uno de los guiones que sueña con dirigir en un futuro, cuando reúna todos los recursos necesarios. Víctor e Ingmar comparten un presente lleno de tristeza y precariedad, pero también plagado de robots y localizaciones de películas que han visto juntos. A pesar de formar un gran equipo, sus problemas se multiplicarán cuando los demás empiecen a cuestionar su papel como padre.","english":"Victor is a washed-up film director, gone to seed since the death of his wife, struggling to support his son Ingmar (named after Ingmar Bergman) with no income and no work. His only friends are a family who manage a run-down cinema with a stockroom full of celluloid classics that nobody pays to see. Victor revels in dreams of past glories, when 'the Americans' sought him for his expertise in special effects, although his recent CV comprises a hamfisted documentary and a silent film about Ancient Greeks, so bad that the only thing people (mis)remember is the Romans and that nobody wants to watch silent films anymore. Ingmar, uninterested in cinematic greats, is happy to watch monster films while his father drinks. Victor keeps busy making films that he never completes, using Ingmar as his cast and crew, while trying to secure funding for his magnum opus, dodging a social worker with concerns about the child, and chasing an inheritance controlled by his estranged sister and debts owed by a former colleague who now films commercial ads. The plot of his planned film hinges on an idealised love story to replace the very real tragedy of his marriage, using fantastical sets and old-school special effects. Eventually Victor must accept reality and tell Ingmar the truth, but not before one last adventure."},"production":[{"country":"Spain","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[{"id":"ES2018_017_01","film":"ES2018_017","person":{"id":"Magüi Mira","slug":"magui-mira","name":"Magüi Mira","birthYear":1944,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"age":"4: Fourth Age (>75)","gender":"Female identifying","sexuality":"Unknown","origin":"White Western European","class":"Middle class","profession":"Unknown","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"},{"id":"ES2018_017_02","film":"ES2018_017","person":{"id":"Kiti Mánver","slug":"kiti-manver","name":"Kiti Mánver","birthYear":1953,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"age":"3: Third Age (60-75)","gender":"Female identifying","sexuality":"Unknown","origin":"White Western European","class":"Middle class","profession":"Employed","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"}],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Kiti Mánver","slug":"kiti-manver","name":"Kiti Mánver","birthYear":1953,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Magüi Mira","slug":"magui-mira","name":"Magüi Mira","birthYear":1944,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Saturnino García","slug":"saturnino-garcia","name":"Saturnino García","birthYear":1935,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Zoe Berriatúa","slug":"zoe-berriatua","name":"Zoe Berriatúa","birthYear":1978,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Álvaro Roig","slug":"alvaro-roig","name":"Álvaro Roig","birthYear":0,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"}],"tags":["grandmotherhood","in-laws","homelessness","substance abuse","grief","urban","education"]}
