What started as innocent local protest, turned into a nightmare, attracting national and international support. As the stakes increased with threats of bankruptcy and imprisonment, ordinary citizens were forced to ask themselves the crucial question: How far am I prepared to go to save a tree? Filmed over 2 years, this is an extraordinary and shocking first-hand account of what happened on the tree-lined suburban streets of Sheffield.","english":""},"production":[{"country":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Eve Wood","slug":"eve-wood","name":"Eve Wood","birthYear":0,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Jacqui Bellamy","slug":"jacqui-bellamy","name":"Jacqui Bellamy","birthYear":0,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"role":"Director of the film"}],"tags":["professional politics","activism","ecology","regional identity","urban","corruption","mass media","state institutions","rescue mission","class solidarity"]}
