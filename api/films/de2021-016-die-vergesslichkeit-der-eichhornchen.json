Doch ganz gleich, wie sehr sich die junge Pflegerin auch anstrengt, der kontrollsüchtigen Almut kann sie nichts recht machen.","english":"After studying German, a young woman from Ukraine has taken a job as a 24-hour caregiver in a family where the adult children have an extremely strained relationship with the demented patriarch out of financial necessity. She promptly gets caught in a veritable minefield of poisoned circumstances, but with sensitivity manages to bring about a gradual change. A tragicomedy that takes up the irritating topic of the German nursing crisis and the working conditions of foreign caregivers with subversive power, whereby the tone changes from depressingly quiet to humorously whimsical and accurate dialogues and gestures impressively explore the social field of tension."},"production":[{"country":"Germany","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[{"id":"DE2021_002_01","film":"DE2021_016","person":"Günther Maria Halmer","age":"4: Fourth Age (>75)","gender":"Male identifying","sexuality":"Heterosexual","origin":"White Eastern European","class":"Upper Middle class","profession":"Retired","ability":"Temporary disability","assistedMobility":"No"}],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Anna Stieblich","slug":"anna-stieblich","name":"Anna Stieblich","birthYear":1965,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Germany"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Fritz Roth","slug":"fritz-roth","name":"Fritz Roth","birthYear":1955,"deathYear":2022,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Germany"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":"Günther Maria Halmer","role":"Leading actor"},{"person":{"id":"Hede Beck","slug":"hede-beck","name":"Hede Beck","birthYear":1958,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Germany"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Marc Dietschreit","slug":"marc-dietschreit","name":"Marc Dietschreit","birthYear":1975,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Germany"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Nadine Heinze","slug":"nadine-heinze","name":"Nadine Heinze","birthYear":1980,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Germany"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Yanina Lisovskaya","slug":"yanina-lisovskaya","name":"Yanina Lisovskaya","birthYear":1961,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Russian Federation (the)"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"}],"tags":["dementia","caregiving","intergenerational conflict","independent home","class conflict"]}
