Mais depuis que Yann a quitté son boulot, il s'est pris de passion pour les bonsaïs. Une passion dévorante qui prend beaucoup de place aux yeux de Catherine, qui se sent quelque peu délaissée. La situation ne va pas s'arranger lorsque leur fille Anna, et son copain Thomas, viennent s'installer chez eux suite à une galère d'appartement. La cohabitation s'avère plus que difficile pour les deux couples que tout oppose...","english":"Catherine and Yann, happily married for many years, should have spent the year travelling abroad. But since he sold his business, Yann has been too busy with his bonsai trees and keeps postponing the big trip. Things go from bad to worse when their 27-year-old broke daughter and her boyfriend lose their apartment and come knocking on the door to stay. With Yann’s mid-life crisis spinning out of control, their couch surfing daughter and partner getting increasingly invasive and their stay becoming indefinite, Catherine will try everything to kick them out of the parental home and get her life back on track!"}}
