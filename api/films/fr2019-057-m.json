Quinze ans après il revient à la recherche des coupables, dans son quartier natal de Bnei Brak, capitale mondiale des Juifs ultra-orthodoxes. Mais c’est aussi le retour dans un monde qu’il a tant aimé, dans un chemin où la parole se libère... une réconciliation.","english":"Suburbs of Tel Aviv. Bnei Brak, world capital of the Haredim, the ultra- Orthodox Jews. When he was a kid, Menahem Lang was known for his kindness, his commitment to Talmud school and especially his golden voice, which made him a renowned performer of liturgical chants. But he was hiding a secret: for years, he was raped by members of the community that worshipped him. After 10 years, Menahem returns to the scene of the crime. It is also a return to the places he loved, a path of initiation sprinkled with incredible encounters, recovered rituals... a reconciliation."}}
