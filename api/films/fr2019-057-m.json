Bnei Brak, world capital of the Haredim, the ultra- Orthodox Jews. When he was a kid, Menahem Lang was known for his kindness, his commitment to Talmud school and especially his golden voice, which made him a renowned performer of liturgical chants. But he was hiding a secret: for years, he was raped by members of the community that worshipped him. After 10 years, Menahem returns to the scene of the crime. It is also a return to the places he loved, a path of initiation sprinkled with incredible encounters, recovered rituals... a reconciliation."},"production":[{"country":"France","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Jean-Pierre Léaud","slug":"jean-pierre-leaud","name":"Jean-Pierre Léaud","birthYear":1944,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Michel Charrel","slug":"michel-charrel","name":"Michel Charrel","birthYear":1936,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Nicolas Vaude","slug":"nicolas-vaude","name":"Nicolas Vaude","birthYear":1962,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Yolande Zauberman","slug":"yolande-zauberman","name":"Yolande Zauberman","birthYear":1955,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Director of the film"}],"tags":["religion","abuse","pedophilia"]}
