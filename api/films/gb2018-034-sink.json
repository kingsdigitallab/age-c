He takes a course of action that is completely out of character, but it's the only way he can see of keeping his family together. It is about surviving, but it's not all anguish and despair - it's also warm and tender, and funny. It's about people finding their way through. It's about Micky Mason; a man out there, right now, doing his best.","english":""},"production":[{"country":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[{"id":"GB2018_034_01","film":"GB2018_034","person":{"id":"Martin Herdman","slug":"martin-herdman","name":"Martin Herdman","birthYear":1956,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"age":"3: Third Age (60-75)","gender":"Male identifying","sexuality":"Heterosexual","origin":"White Western European","class":"Lower class","profession":"Unemployed","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"},{"id":"GB2018_034_02","film":"GB2018_034","person":{"id":"Ian Hogg","slug":"ian-hogg","name":"Ian Hogg","birthYear":1937,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"age":"4: Fourth Age (>75)","gender":"Male identifying","sexuality":"Heterosexual","origin":"White Western European","class":"Lower Middle class","profession":"Retired","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"},{"id":"GB2018_034_03","film":"GB2018_034","person":"Marlene Sidaway","age":"4: Fourth Age (>75)","gender":"Female identifying","sexuality":"Heterosexual","origin":"White Western European","class":"Lower Middle class","profession":"Unknown","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"}],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Ian Hogg","slug":"ian-hogg","name":"Ian Hogg","birthYear":1937,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Joanna Monro","slug":"joanna-monro","name":"Joanna Monro","birthYear":1956,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Mark Gillis","slug":"mark-gillis","name":"Mark Gillis","birthYear":0,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":"Marlene Sidaway","role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Martin Herdman","slug":"martin-herdman","name":"Martin Herdman","birthYear":1956,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"role":"Leading actor"}],"tags":["unemployment","2008 crisis","state institutions","precarity","sex","fatherhood","multigenerational family","well-being","homosociality","cross-gender friendship","intergenerational conflict","partnership","urban","independent home","low rank employment","class solidarity"]}
