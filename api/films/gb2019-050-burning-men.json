Frustrated by the shortfall in funds, they steal an uber-rare Black Metal record at a Camden record fair and head out of town to sell it. As they drive north in their beaten-up Volvo Amazon, picking up hitchhiker Susie (Elinor Crawley) en route, they find themselves stalked by dark forces apparently unleashed by the devil disc they have stolen.","english":""},"production":[{"country":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[{"id":"GB2019_050_01","film":"GB2019_050","person":{"id":"Christopher Fulford","slug":"christopher-fulford","name":"Christopher Fulford","birthYear":1955,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"age":"3: Third Age (60-75)","gender":"Male identifying","sexuality":"Unknown","origin":"White Western European","class":"Middle class","profession":"Unknown","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"}],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Christopher Fulford","slug":"christopher-fulford","name":"Christopher Fulford","birthYear":1955,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Denise Welch","slug":"denise-welch","name":"Denise Welch","birthYear":1958,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Jeremy Wooding","slug":"jeremy-wooding","name":"Jeremy Wooding","birthYear":0,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"role":"Director of the film"}],"tags":["rural","independent home","mentorship"]}
