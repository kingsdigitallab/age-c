Dès leur arrivée, ils entament un véritable parcours du combattant pour obtenir l’asile politique, avec la menace d’être expulsés à tout moment. Grâce à son don pour les échecs, Fahim rencontre Sylvain, l’un des meilleurs entraîneurs d’échecs de France. Entre méfiance et attirance, ils vont apprendre à se connaître et se lier d’amitié. Alors que le Championnat de France commence, la menace d’expulsion se fait pressante et Fahim n’a plus qu’une seule chance pour s’en sortir : être Champion de France.","english":"Forced to flee his native Bangladesh, eight year-old chess prodigy Fahim arrives in Paris with his father. Refused asylum, as illegal immigrants they spiral downwards into homelessness and desperation. By a stroke of luck, Fahim is introduced to one of France’s top chess coaches, Sylvain (real name: Xavier Parmentier), who tutors him and gives him a sense of purpose - his struggles on the chessboard mirroring both his victories and his crushing defeats in his battle for a normal life. Fahim then rises through local and national tournaments only to be crowned France’s Under-12 Chess Champion in 2012. The film tells the story of a child who learns to live without his mother and without his father, far from home, from his roots and his language. Fahim’s tale is not only a moving account of the grim realities that underlie a supposedly caring society, but also a heartwarming testimony to a father’s determination, the kindness of strangers, and one small boy’s courageous will to succeed."},"production":[{"country":"France","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[{"id":"FR2019_170_01","film":"FR2019_170","person":{"id":"Gérard Depardieu","slug":"gerard-depardieu","name":"Gérard Depardieu","birthYear":1948,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Russian Federation (the)"},"age":"3: Third Age (60-75)","gender":"Male identifying","sexuality":"Unknown","origin":"White Western European","class":"Middle class","profession":"Self-employed","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"},{"id":"FR2019_170_02","film":"FR2019_170","person":{"id":"Isabelle Nanty","slug":"isabelle-nanty","name":"Isabelle Nanty","birthYear":1962,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"France"},"age":"2: Late Middle Age (55-60)","gender":"Female identifying","sexuality":"Unknown","origin":"White Western European","class":"Upper Middle class","profession":"Self-employed","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"}],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Didier Flamand","slug":"didier-flamand","name":"Didier Flamand","birthYear":1947,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Gérard Depardieu","slug":"gerard-depardieu","name":"Gérard Depardieu","birthYear":1948,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Russian Federation (the)"},"role":"Leading actor"},{"person":{"id":"Isabelle Nanty","slug":"isabelle-nanty","name":"Isabelle Nanty","birthYear":1962,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Leading actor"},{"person":{"id":"Pierre-François Martin-Laval","slug":"pierre-francois-martin-laval","name":"Pierre-François Martin-Laval","birthYear":1968,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Director of the film"}],"tags":["urban","mentorship","education","interracial relationships"]}
