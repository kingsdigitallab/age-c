Jouant avec les émotions et les sentiments – surtout ceux des autres – brouillant les pistes entre réalité et fiction, elle prend des risques dont elle ne mesure pas toujours les conséquences… Son couple y résistera-t-il ? Finira- t-elle son film ?","english":"A director is filming a documentary on polyamory: somewhere between documentary and fiction, she takes risks and she cannot always measure the consequences. As a combination of documentary and fiction, the film could be classified as a 'UMO': Unidentified Movie Object! On the one hand: a serious, poised, and thought-through documentary with speakers who have reflected on the topic or who live it everyday. On the other hand: a comedy about a female director who plays with fire by testing out polyamory on her own relationship. Between the two, a grey area in which fiction gets entangled with reality. Will her sweetheart be able to stand up to the challenge of polyamory? Will she finish her film?"},"production":[{"country":"France","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Anne Benoît","slug":"anne-benoit","name":"Anne Benoît","birthYear":1959,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Isabelle Broué","slug":"isabelle-broue","name":"Isabelle Broué","birthYear":1968,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Director of the film"}],"tags":["self-employment"]}
