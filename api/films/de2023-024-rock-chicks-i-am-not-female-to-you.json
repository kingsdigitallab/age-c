In ihrem Dokumentarfilm „Rock Chicks“ bricht die Filmemacherin Marita Stocker mit diesem Stereotyp und stellt fest, dass bereits ab Mitte der 1950er-Jahre junge Hausfrauen das geordnete Leben gegen ein Leben auf der Straße tauschten und fortan als „Godmothers of Rock’n’Roll“ die Bühnen rockten.","english":"The world out there on stages is a man's world. Or is that just what they want us to believe? What if the true King of Rock and Roll is a Queen? Listen closely and you hear Memphis Minnie's guitar in Chuck Berry and Eric Clapton, Sister Rosetta's unbridled spirit in Jerry Lee Lewis, Big Mama Thornton's growl in Elvis. Still the fact that women rocked the stages from the1950s on has been successfully pushed out of the collective memory. Time to pull out the roots and tell the other side of the story. The women we meet on our journey devote their life's to rock music, each of them is an icebreaker and they are as inspiring as different. 'You have to be like a man. But I can do it, I am a woman with balls', is Linda Gail Lewis' Credo, while Kathy Valentine of The Go-Go's considers herself a 'rare bird'. Suzi Quatro proclaims that she doesn't do gender at all, while Rosie Flores emphasizes her female qualities when playing the guitar. And Kristin Hersh of Throwing Muses decided to leave the sexist music business to be listener-supported, because: 'What would my kids think if I looked at every camera like I wanted to fuck it - as they tell you to do?'"},"production":[{"country":"Germany","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Kathy Valentine","slug":"kathy-valentine","name":"Kathy Valentine","birthYear":1959,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"United States of America (the)"},"role":"Documentary subject"},{"person":{"id":"Kristin Hersh","slug":"kristin-hersh","name":"Kristin Hersh","birthYear":1966,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"United States of America (the)"},"role":"Documentary subject"},{"person":{"id":"Linda Gail Lewis","slug":"linda-gail-lewis","name":"Linda Gail Lewis","birthYear":1947,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"United States of America (the)"},"role":"Documentary subject"},{"person":{"id":"Marita Stocker","slug":"marita-stocker","name":"Marita Stocker","birthYear":0,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Unknown","nationality":"Unknown"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Rosie Flores","slug":"rosie-flores","name":"Rosie Flores","birthYear":1950,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"United States of America (the)"},"role":"Documentary subject"},{"person":{"id":"Suzi Quatro","slug":"suzi-quatro","name":"Suzi Quatro","birthYear":1950,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"United States of America (the)"},"role":"Documentary subject"}],"tags":["personal memory","cultural memory","artistic creation","celebrity"]}
