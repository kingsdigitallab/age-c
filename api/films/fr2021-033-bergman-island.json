A mesure que leurs scénarios respectifs avancent, et au contact des paysages sauvages de l’île, la frontière entre fiction et réalité se brouille…","english":"A couple of American filmmakers, Chris (P.T. Anderson’s Phantom Thread superstar Vicky Krieps) and Tony (Tim Roth) retreat to the mythical Fårö island for the Summer. In this wild, breathtaking landscape where Bergman lived and shot his most celebrated pieces, they hope to find inspiration for their upcoming films. As days spent separately pass by, the fascination for the island operates on Chris and souvenirs of her first love resurface. Lines between reality and fiction will then progressively blur and tear our couple even more apart."},"production":[{"country":"France","share":"Majority coproducer"},{"country":"Belgium","share":"Minority coproducer"},{"country":"Germany","share":"Minority coproducer"},{"country":"Sweden","share":"Minority coproducer"},{"country":"Mexico","share":"Minority coproducer"}],"characters":[{"id":"FR2021_033_01","film":"FR2021_033","person":{"id":"Tim Roth","slug":"tim-roth","name":"Tim Roth","birthYear":1961,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Unknown"},"age":"2: Late Middle Age (55-60)","gender":"Male identifying","sexuality":"Heterosexual","origin":"White Western European","class":"Upper Middle class","profession":"Self-employed","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"}],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Mia Hansen-Løve","slug":"mia-hansen-love","name":"Mia Hansen-Løve","birthYear":1981,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Tim Roth","slug":"tim-roth","name":"Tim Roth","birthYear":1961,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Unknown"},"role":"Leading actor"}],"tags":["artistic creation","self-employment","may-december","fatherhood","natural","holiday","marriage"]}
