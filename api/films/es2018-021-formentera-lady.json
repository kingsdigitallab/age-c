Vive sin luz y toca el banjo en un garito. Un día recibe la visita, después de muchos años, de su hija Anna y de su nieto Marc. Anna, desempleada desde hace tiempo, dice que ha tenido que aceptar un trabajo en Francia y se ve obligada a dejar en la isla a su hijo con Samuel.","english":"Samuel is an old hippie musician who settled in Formentera in the 1970s, when King Crimson and other British rock bands frequented the island. There he lives austerely, in a ramshackle house without electric light or unnecessary luxuries, and plays the banjo in a friends' club. Until one day, after many years, he receives the unexpected visit of his daughter Anna and his grandson Marc. Anna, unemployed for some time, says she has had to accept a job in France and is forced to leave her little son on the island with grandfather Samuel."}}
