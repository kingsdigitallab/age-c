There he lives austerely, in a ramshackle house without electric light or unnecessary luxuries, and plays the banjo in a friends' club. Until one day, after many years, he receives the unexpected visit of his daughter Anna and his grandson Marc. Anna, unemployed for some time, says she has had to accept a job in France and is forced to leave her little son on the island with grandfather Samuel."},"production":[{"country":"Spain","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[{"id":"ES2018_021_01","film":"ES2018_021","person":{"id":"José Sacristán","slug":"jose-sacristan","name":"José Sacristán","birthYear":1937,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"age":"4: Fourth Age (>75)","gender":"Male identifying","sexuality":"Heterosexual","origin":"White Western European","class":"Lower class","profession":"Self-employed","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"},{"id":"ES2018_021_02","film":"ES2018_021","person":{"id":"Ferran Rañé","slug":"ferran-rane","name":"Ferran Rañé","birthYear":1950,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"age":"3: Third Age (60-75)","gender":"Male identifying","sexuality":"Unknown","origin":"White Western European","class":"Lower Middle class","profession":"Self-employed","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"},{"id":"ES2018_021_03","film":"ES2018_021","person":{"id":"Juli Mira","slug":"juli-mira","name":"Juli Mira","birthYear":1949,"deathYear":2024,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"age":"3: Third Age (60-75)","gender":"Male identifying","sexuality":"Heterosexual","origin":"White Western European","class":"Middle class","profession":"Retired","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"},{"id":"ES2018_021_04","film":"ES2018_021","person":{"id":"Laura Pons","slug":"laura-pons","name":"Laura Pons","birthYear":1945,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"age":"4: Fourth Age (>75)","gender":"Female identifying","sexuality":"Heterosexual","origin":"White Western European","class":"Middle class","profession":"Retired","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"}],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Ferran Rañé","slug":"ferran-rane","name":"Ferran Rañé","birthYear":1950,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"José Sacristán","slug":"jose-sacristan","name":"José Sacristán","birthYear":1937,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"role":"Leading actor"},{"person":{"id":"Juli Cantó","slug":"juli-canto","name":"Juli Cantó","birthYear":1958,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Juli Mira","slug":"juli-mira","name":"Juli Mira","birthYear":1949,"deathYear":2024,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Laura Pons","slug":"laura-pons","name":"Laura Pons","birthYear":1945,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Pau Durà","slug":"pau-dura","name":"Pau Durà","birthYear":1972,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Spain"},"role":"Director of the film"}],"tags":["return home","search for meaning","may-december","physical illness","substance abuse","caregiving","hospital","fatherhood","grandfatherhood","homosociality","intergenerational friendship","intragenerational friendship","cross-gender friendship","non-human companionship","separation","personal memory","legacy","rural","natural","independent home","precarity","self-employment","artistic creation","education"]}
