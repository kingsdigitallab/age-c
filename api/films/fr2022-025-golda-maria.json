Face à la caméra, ses souvenirs reviennent, de son enfance en Pologne à sa vie de femme en France, nous livrant le témoignage vivant d’une femme juive née en 1910, sa traversée du siècle et de ses horreurs. En 2020, Patrick et son fils Hugo ont fait de ce témoignage intime un film, universel et essentiel.","english":"Born in 1910 in a Jewish family in Poland, raised in 1920’s Berlin, she has to fly to Paris in 1933 and run again to the free zone during the war, where she is separated from her husband and daughter. In May 1944, just a few days before the Normandy landing, she is arrested and deported with her young son. After 12 months in the horror of the camps, she comes back to Paris, without her son but with a life to resume. And a family to love."}}
