An insurance Loss Adjuster for many years, he spends his time assessing other people's problems and ignoring his own. His wife Angie aspires to greater things and when finances hit rock bottom, she leaves him for a suave loan shark one week before Christmas. Martin is crest fallen but forced into continuing his day by the overly exuberant company secretary, who has scheduled several claims for Martin to validate. With a heavy heart, Martin sets off but his day drastically goes from bad to worse with a catalogue of extraordinary and humorous encounters with a flirtatious and rather amorous widow, a corrupt Doctor, a lascivious female escort and a dead rat. It is only at the funeral of a client that Martin has an epiphany; and with the help of his unlikely friendship with a teenage thief and perhaps a sprinkling of Christmas magic, life suddenly changes in a truly remarkable way.","english":""},"production":[{"country":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[{"id":"GB2020_026_01","film":"GB2020_026","person":{"id":"Guy Siner","slug":"guy-siner","name":"Guy Siner","birthYear":1947,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"United States of America (the)"},"age":"3: Third Age (60-75)","gender":"Male identifying","sexuality":"Unknown","origin":"White Western European","class":"Middle class","profession":"Retired","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"},{"id":"GB2020_026_02","film":"GB2020_026","person":{"id":"Joan Collins","slug":"joan-collins","name":"Joan Collins","birthYear":1933,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"age":"4: Fourth Age (>75)","gender":"Female identifying","sexuality":"Unknown","origin":"White Western European","class":"Upper Middle class","profession":"Retired","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"}],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Guy Siner","slug":"guy-siner","name":"Guy Siner","birthYear":1947,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"United States of America (the)"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Joan Collins","slug":"joan-collins","name":"Joan Collins","birthYear":1933,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Tony O'Callaghan","slug":"tony-o-callaghan","name":"Tony O'Callaghan","birthYear":1956,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Vincent Woods","slug":"vincent-woods","name":"Vincent Woods","birthYear":0,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)"},"role":"Director of the film"}],"tags":["festivities","urban","independent home","wealth","retirement"]}
