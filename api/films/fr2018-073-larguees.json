Her sister Alice couldn’t be more different : a helicopter parent with her life on rails who prides herself in having control over every single aspect of her life. They don't agree on much, except on one thing : they urgently need to cheer up their mother, Françoise, who has just been left by their father for a much younger woman. To celebrate her 60th birthday, Rose and Alice decide to take their mother to a resort on the tropical island of Reunion so they can relax, work on their tans, and have too many margaritas. But when Rose pays a one-night stand, Thierry, to show her mother a good time, their holiday plans start to unravel. What was supposed to be a small confidence-booster turns into something more, as Rose desperately tries to stop things from spiralling out of control..."}}
