Aufgrund seines einzigartigen Stils gilt Gonzales als Vorbild für zahlreiche andere Künstler, darunter Feist, Jarvis Cocker, Peaches, Daft Punk und Drake. In „Shut Up And Play The Piano“ zeichnet der Regisseur, Philipp Jedicke, den Weg von Gonzales aus seiner kanadischen Heimat über die Berliner Underground-Szene der 90er Jahre bis in die Pariser Konzerthäuser der Gegenwart nach und beleuchtet dessen Bühnenfigur von allen Seiten. In der Dokumentation ist unveröffentlichtes Material aus Gonzales’ persönlichem Video-Archiv genauso zu sehen wie neu gedrehte Interviews, Live-Mitschnitte von Auftritten und Spielfilmszenen.","english":"Chilly Gonzales is a Grammy-winning composer, virtuoso pianist and entertainer. Criss-crossing between rap, electro and solo piano music, he became the outrageous pop performer who invited himself to the ivory tower of classical music. The eccentric artist inspires and collaborates with the likes of Feist, Jarvis Cocker, Peaches, Daft Punk and Drake. Change seems to be the only constant in Gonzales' journey. Every time his audience thinks it has finally figured him out, he makes a radical move and breaks with its expectations. The cinematic documentary Shut Up And Play The Piano follows Gonzales from his native Canada to late 90's underground Berlin, and via Paris to the world's great philharmonic halls. It dives deep into the dichotomy of Gonzales' stage persona, where self-doubt and megalomania are just two sides of the same coin. The playfulness of his character is mirrored in the look of the film. Using Gonzales' extensive video archive in a rather unorthodox manner, Shut Up And Play The Piano explores his persona by interweaving newly shot interviews and concert scenes with fictional materials of totally different time periods. Reality and fiction blur together as we embark on a trip through Chilly Gonzales' world."},"production":[{"country":"Germany","share":"Majority coproducer"},{"country":"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)","share":"Minority coproducer"},{"country":"France","share":"Minority coproducer"}],"characters":[],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Jarvis Cocker","slug":"jarvis-cocker","name":"Jarvis Cocker","birthYear":1963,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Unknown"},"role":"Documentary subject"},{"person":{"id":"Martin Bentz","slug":"martin-bentz","name":"Martin Bentz","birthYear":1961,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Germany"},"role":"Documentary subject"},{"person":{"id":"Philipp Jedicke","slug":"philipp-jedicke","name":"Philipp Jedicke","birthYear":1977,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Germany"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Sibylle Berg","slug":"sibylle-berg","name":"Sibylle Berg","birthYear":1962,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Germany"},"role":"Documentary subject"}],"tags":["celebrity","cultural memory"]}
