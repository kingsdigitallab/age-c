Le spectacle sera sur scène et dans l’assiette, avec les bons produits du coin. Il en est sûr, ça ne peut que marcher ! Ses proches, sa mère et surtout son grand-père, sont plus sceptiques.","english":"Hard work and big ideas aren't enough. David's dairy farm is on the brink of liquidation. When he chances upon a dazzling nightclub performance by Bonnie Starlight, inspiration strikes. What if he turned his big old barn into a country cabaret? Not just for entertainment, but to promote local food producers, including his mother's delicious cheese. A crazy plan, for sure - which is exactly why he loves it! David has to convince sophisticated “City Girl” Bonnie to live in a converted barn loft out in the middle of nowhere and work around the clock to make a great show out of nothing. Finding local talent is no small feat either, but together they manage to assemble a zany cast of characters and create a troupe. Through blood sweat and tears, and a whole lot of laughs, they not only build a great stage and get their act together, they also learn a thing or two about themselves and each other. Everything seems on track for the big opening night, until David's traditionalist grandpa steps in, hell-bent on putting an end to their follies. Can they save the show and save the farm?"},"production":[{"country":"France","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Guy Marchand","slug":"guy-marchand","name":"Guy Marchand","birthYear":1937,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Jean-Pierre Améris","slug":"jean-pierre-ameris","name":"Jean-Pierre Améris","birthYear":1961,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Michèle Bernier","slug":"michele-bernier","name":"Michèle Bernier","birthYear":1956,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Moussa Maaskri","slug":"moussa-maaskri","name":"Moussa Maaskri","birthYear":1962,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Algeria"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Patrik Cottet-Moine","slug":"patrik-cottet-moine","name":"Patrik Cottet-Moine","birthYear":1964,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"}],"tags":["parenthood","grandparenthood","rural","retirement","independent home"]}
