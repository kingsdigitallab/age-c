After 10 years of happy marriage and a thriving career as a bestselling author, Raphael has it all – or so he thinks. After a huge argument between the couple, Raphael wakes up in parallel life as an unmarried, ping pong playing, middle-school teacher who’s been glued to his childhood best friend for a little too long. Realizing Olivia was his everything, he must go above and beyond to win back the love of his life – who in this world has absolutely no idea who he is."},"production":[{"country":"France","share":"Majority coproducer"},{"country":"Belgium","share":"Minority coproducer"}],"characters":[],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Christian Benedetti","slug":"christian-benedetti","name":"Christian Benedetti","birthYear":1958,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Hugo Gélin","slug":"hugo-gelin","name":"Hugo Gélin","birthYear":1980,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Patrice Melennec","slug":"patrice-melennec","name":"Patrice Melennec","birthYear":1942,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Édith Scob","slug":"edith-scob","name":"Édith Scob","birthYear":1937,"deathYear":2019,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"}],"tags":["low rank employment"]}
