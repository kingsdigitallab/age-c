Alexandra, qui travaille depuis peu pour une banque française à Tokyo, se retrouve au cœur de cette crise. Tiraillée entre les ordres de sa direction et la volonté de protéger sa famille et ses collaborateurs, Alexandra tente de composer avec la situation et se retrouve, presque malgré elle, à défendre une certaine idée de l’honneur.","english":"March 11, 2011. The biggest tsunami Japan has ever experienced triggers the Fukushima disaster. Risks are being downplayed but the foreign community in Tokyo is terrified by this tragic event and the fact that no one is capable of assessing its scope. Among them, Alexandra, a French executive newly arrived from Hong Kong to work in a bank, has to face this nuclear crisis. Torn apart between following the company’s instructions and going back to her husband and children who are still in Hong Kong, she will find herself defending honor and given word, despite the pervading terror and chaos."}}
