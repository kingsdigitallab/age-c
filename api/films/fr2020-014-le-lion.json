But of course, that’s just crazy talk, right? Maybe not. When Romain’s fiancée is kidnapped before his very eyes, just as The Lion predicted, Romain realizes that Léo is the only one who seems to know what’s going on. And only he has the skills to rescue her. Desperate, Romain breaks out The Lion and does his best to keep up with him, in a frantic chase across Paris to rescue Louise and protect France’s central bank from the heist of the century."},"production":[{"country":"France","share":"Majority coproducer"},{"country":"Belgium","share":"Minority coproducer"}],"characters":[],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Ludovic Colbeau-Justin","slug":"ludovic-colbeau-justin","name":"Ludovic Colbeau-Justin","birthYear":1972,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Nicolas Briançon","slug":"nicolas-briancon","name":"Nicolas Briançon","birthYear":1962,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Philippe Duquesne","slug":"philippe-duquesne","name":"Philippe Duquesne","birthYear":1965,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"}],"tags":["self-employment","low rank employment"]}
