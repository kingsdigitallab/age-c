Margarethe von Trotta was back in the 1960s one of the very few women working as a film director and has layed the foundation for many young female artists. In February 2022 she will turn 80, offering the perfect opportunity to make a full-length documentary film about her. Her filmography is one of the most important in international film history and she is currently working on adding to her already impressive portfolio with a new, major feature film. The exciting thing about this project is that it explores important periods in German history via her films. The 1960s, the RAF era, the women’s movement and the Fall of the Wall – Margarethe von Trotta’s films have dealt with all of these topics. And at the same time, von Trotta is a subtle investigator of the architecture of the human soul – the female soul, in particular."},"production":[{"country":"Germany","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[{"id":"DE2022_081_01","film":"DE2022_081","person":{"id":"Margarethe von Trotta","slug":"margarethe-von-trotta","name":"Margarethe von Trotta","birthYear":1942,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Germany"},"age":"4: Fourth Age (>75)","gender":"Female identifying","sexuality":"Heterosexual","origin":"White Western European","class":"Upper class","profession":"Self-employed","ability":"Able-bodied","assistedMobility":"No"}],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Cuini Amelio-Ortiz","slug":"cuini-amelio-ortiz","name":"Cuini Amelio-Ortiz","birthYear":0,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Argentina"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Margarethe von Trotta","slug":"margarethe-von-trotta","name":"Margarethe von Trotta","birthYear":1942,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Germany"},"role":"Documentary subject"},{"person":{"id":"Peter Altmann","slug":"peter-altmann","name":"Peter Altmann","birthYear":1973,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Germany"},"role":"Director of the film"}],"tags":["artistic creation","women empowerment","cultural memory","collective trauma"]}
