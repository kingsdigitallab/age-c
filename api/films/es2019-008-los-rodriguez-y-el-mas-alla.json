Todo cambiará para ellos cuando descubran que el difunto abuelo era, en realidad, de otro planeta. Su nieto, Nicolás, abre en el trastero de la casa familiar una puerta cósmica por donde acceder al “más allá”. Y a partir de ahí, el caos se apoderará de esta familia, que deberá aprender a controlar los superpoderes que ha recibido.","english":"The father turns on as a light bulb, the older daughter has super-strength, the younger daughter is capable to be invisible, the grandmother floats and the son is super-intelligent. Definitely this family is from another world."}}
