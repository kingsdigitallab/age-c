Il a de grandes espérances et veut se forger un destin. Il quitte l’imprimerie familiale de sa province natale pour tenter sa chance à Paris, au bras de sa protectrice. Bientôt livré à lui-même dans la ville fabuleuse, le jeune homme va découvrir les coulisses d’un monde voué à la loi du profit et des faux-semblants. Une comédie humaine où tout s’achète et se vend, la littérature comme la presse, la politique comme les sentiments, les réputations comme les âmes. Il va aimer, il va souffrir, et survivre à ses illusions.","english":"Lucien is a young unknown poet in 19th-century France. He has great expectations and wants to forge a destiny. He leaves the family printing business in his native province to try his luck in Paris, on the arm of his protector. Soon left to his own devices in the fabulous city, the young man will discover the backstage of a world dedicated to the law of profit and pretense. A human comedy where everything is bought and sold, literature as well as the press, politics as well as feelings, reputations as well as souls. He will love, he will suffer, and survive his illusions."},"production":[{"country":"France","share":"Majority coproducer"},{"country":"Belgium","share":"Minority coproducer"}],"characters":[],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"André Marcon","slug":"andre-marcon","name":"André Marcon","birthYear":1948,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Armand Éloi","slug":"armand-eloi","name":"Armand Éloi","birthYear":1962,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Belgium"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Gérard Depardieu","slug":"gerard-depardieu","name":"Gérard Depardieu","birthYear":1948,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Russian Federation (the)"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Jean-François Stévenin","slug":"jean-francois-stevenin","name":"Jean-François Stévenin","birthYear":1944,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Jean-Marie Frin","slug":"jean-marie-frin","name":"Jean-Marie Frin","birthYear":1949,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Jean-Paul Muel","slug":"jean-paul-muel","name":"Jean-Paul Muel","birthYear":1944,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Louis-Do de Lencquesaing","slug":"louis-do-de-lencquesaing","name":"Louis-Do de Lencquesaing","birthYear":1963,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Xavier Giannoli","slug":"xavier-giannoli","name":"Xavier Giannoli","birthYear":1972,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Director of the film"}],"tags":["wealth","self-employment","urban","class conflict"]}
