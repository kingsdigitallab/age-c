Han pasado años tras la Guerra Civil Española, pero muchos maquis siguen escondidos combatiendo al franquismo. Uno de ellos es Anselmo, que se queda sordo tras una acción de sabotaje dentro de la llamada ‘Operación reconquista’. Escondido por los montes, acorralado por el ejército dirigido por el Capitán Bosch y ayudado por la mercenaria Darya Sergéevich, el silencio de su sordera será su acompañante y su espejo, pero sobre todo su enemigo.","english":"October, 1944.
