Remi sets off on a long journey through France with his new master, their faithful dog Capi and mischievous monkey Mister Joli-Cœur. From adventures to misadventures, young Remi endears himself to Vitalis, who teaches him to read and helps him discover his extraordinary singing talent. The boy learns the rough life of a travelling showman and suffers through hunger, cold and sometimes great injustice.
