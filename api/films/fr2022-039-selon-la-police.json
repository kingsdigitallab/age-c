Durant un jour et une nuit, ses collègues le cherchent, le croisent et le perdent dans Toulouse et sa banlieue. Mais chaque heure qui passe rapproche un peu plus Ping-Pong de son destin.","english":"On a whim, Ping-Pong, Chief Warrant Officer of a brigade which he inherited his nickname from, burns his police ID and disappears.
