The world has changed since the last adventures of OSS 117, France’s finest secret agent. Feminism is gaining ground, computer technology is developing… and Communists lurk everywhere. In the midst of all this tumult, France sends its top spy to Africa to help out President Bamba, whose reelection is threatened by rebels led covertly by his young wife!
