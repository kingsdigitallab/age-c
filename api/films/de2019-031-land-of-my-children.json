Doch ist er so weit?","english":"Darío Aguirre moved from Ecuador to Germany to be with Stephanie, but from the very first day there was a third party in their relationship:the government. They issued him ten visas in fifteen years. A long trail of papers, stamps, permits, and restrictions connected Darío to Germany while also keeping him at a distance. Then one fine day the mayor of Hamburg invites Darío to become a German citizen. A confession of love? Darío responds with a tender, ironic road movie that traces his intertwined journey from the country of his fathers to the country of his children."},"production":[{"country":"Germany","share":"Majority coproducer"},{"country":"Switzerland","share":"Minority coproducer"}],"characters":[],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Dario Aguirre","slug":"dario-aguirre","name":"Dario Aguirre","birthYear":1979,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Ecuador"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Olaf Scholz","slug":"olaf-scholz","name":"Olaf Scholz","birthYear":1958,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Germany"},"role":"Documentary subject"}],"tags":["migration","racial discrimination","state institutions"]}
