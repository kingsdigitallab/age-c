Zehn verschiedene Visa, die Rolle als Ausländer und sein immer noch holpriges Deutsch hat er als Teil seiner Geschichte akzeptiert. Doch ist er so weit?","english":"Darío Aguirre moved from Ecuador to Germany to be with Stephanie, but from the very first day there was a third party in their relationship:the government. They issued him ten visas in fifteen years. A long trail of papers, stamps, permits, and restrictions connected Darío to Germany while also keeping him at a distance. Then one fine day the mayor of Hamburg invites Darío to become a German citizen. A confession of love? Darío responds with a tender, ironic road movie that traces his intertwined journey from the country of his fathers to the country of his children."}}
