Like the statue emerging from the granite, his memories, too, emerge, fragmented, inlaid between History and the personal experiences of Shelomo, who was a first-hand witness to the events. His son Rami, who is a plastic surgeon, and Pierre Abramovici, a historian and family friend, guide us on this journey made of history and art, between the need to remember and the need to forget."},"production":[{"country":"Italy","share":"Majority coproducer"},{"country":"France","share":"Minority coproducer"}],"characters":[],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"Anna Recalde Miranda","slug":"anna-recalde-miranda","name":"Anna Recalde Miranda","birthYear":0,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Italy"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Pierre Abramovici","slug":"pierre-abramovici","name":"Pierre Abramovici","birthYear":1955,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"Shelomo Selinger","slug":"shelomo-selinger","name":"Shelomo Selinger","birthYear":1928,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"France"},"role":"Documentary subject"}],"tags":["artistic creation","collective trauma"]}
