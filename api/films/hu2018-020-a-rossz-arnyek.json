The painting in question is The Ambassadors, the well known work of Hans Holbein which at several points inflicts a wound upon a reality depicted as harmonious and complete. One such wound is the anamorphic skull which drifts in the foreground of the painting conveying a paradox impression that makes the viewer question what he/she sees and does not see. This visual sensation arouses the suspicion that here, within the universe of Holbein's painting rhizomatic meanings run along behind and beyond the simple representation as the story of the characters in the film is also mysteriously connected to events of this 500 year old time segment."},"production":[{"country":"Hungary","share":"Majority coproducer"}],"characters":[],"roles":[{"person":{"id":"András Jeles","slug":"andras-jeles","name":"András Jeles","birthYear":1945,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Hungary"},"role":"Director of the film"},{"person":{"id":"György Árvai","slug":"gyorgy-arvai","name":"György Árvai","birthYear":1959,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Hungary"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Györgyi Kari","slug":"gyorgyi-kari","name":"Györgyi Kari","birthYear":1955,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Female identifying","nationality":"Hungary"},"role":"Supporting actor"},{"person":{"id":"Gábor Medvigy","slug":"gabor-medvigy","name":"Gábor Medvigy","birthYear":1957,"deathYear":2023,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Hungary"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"László Melis","slug":"laszlo-melis","name":"László Melis","birthYear":1953,"deathYear":2018,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Hungary"},"role":"Minor actor/Cameo"},{"person":{"id":"Tibor Pálffy","slug":"tibor-palffy","name":"Tibor Pálffy","birthYear":1967,"deathYear":0,"gender":"Male identifying","nationality":"Romania"},"role":"Supporting actor"}],"tags":["fatherhood","artistic creation"]}
