A travers leurs histoires croisées se dessine un portrait de la Chine d’aujourd’hui entre culture traditionnelle et modernité. La solidarité, la tendresse et le sens de l’humour permettent aux familles et patients de tenir le cap face aux aléas de la vie.","english":"Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital is one of the largest in the city. Here, medical staff, patients, and families with disrupted lives rub shoulders. Through their intersecting stories, a portrait of today's China, oscillating between capitalism and traditional culture, is drawn. In the face of life's ups and downs and unequal access to health care, Chinese tenderness and humor emerge when least expected."}}
