One day or another, they come across a case hurting them more than the others, without always knowing why. It starts spinning in their heads to the point of obsession. Young and ambitious Captain Vivés has just been appointed group leader at the Grenoble Criminal Squad when Clara's murder case lands on his desk. Vivés and his team investigate Clara's complex life and relations, but what starts as a professional and methodical immersion into the victim's life soon turns into a haunting obsession."}}
