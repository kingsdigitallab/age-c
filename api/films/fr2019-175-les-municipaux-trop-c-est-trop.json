La révolte gronde, le syndicat majoritaire, puisqu’unique, des Municipaux organise la riposte. Le secrétaire national en personne vient en consultation. Sur sa proposition, une décision historique est prise : les municipaux feront la grève du zèle.","english":"The charming small port of Port-Vendres, with its 280 municipal employees, is shaken by a rumour: the Mayor, assisted by his department head, a Parisian who has studied at an elite business school, have the dark intention of reducing the staff of communal employees. Revolt rumbles, the majority and almost single union of the municipal employees organizes a response. The national secretary himself comes to consult. Upon his proposition, an historic decision is made: the municipal employees will strike."}}
